Longshore drift  
Waves can move sand and pebbles along the shore. This happens in places where the prevailing wind blows the waves towards the shore at an angle. Instead of flowing back in the direction it came from, the water from the wave goes straight back down the beach. Any sand and pebbles carried by the waves also slowly travel along the shore in this zig-zag pattern. This movement is called longshore drift.


Geography T D 3 M

Activity  
Deposition  
When something on the coastline, such as a bay or the mouth of a river, makes the waves move more slowly, they no longer have the energy to carry sand and shingle. The waves then slow down and deposit or drop the materials they were carrying.

Mountains and temperature  
As you climb up a mountain, the weather changes. The higher you go, the colder it gets. The temperature falls by about 2 degrees Celsius for each 300 metres you climb. If you climb high enough, you will eventually reach the snow line. Above this height, it is so cold that snow covers the ground even in summer. This is why there is snow on the tops of very high mountains near the Equator.


Geography T D 3 M

Activity  
What is a rain shadow?  
The upper parts of mountains are often covered in clouds. Clouds are made up of tiny water droplets. Mountains cause the clouds to rise so high that the droplets join together. The bigger drops fall as rain or snow. Often the rain or snow falls on only one side of the mountain, called the windward side. The other side of the mountain, the leeward side, which receives much less rain or snow, is said to be in a rain shadow.

Mountain weather and land use  
The Sun affects the different sides of a mountain differently. One side may be in sunshine and the other in shadow. Also, because cold air is heavier than warm air, it tends to sink into the valleys. That is why orchards of fruit trees are planted on the lower slopes of a mountain and not in the bottom of a valley. Villages are often built on the lower slopes of a mountain too, rather than in the colder valley bottom.

Activity 
Many early towns and villages were built near rivers because the rivers stopped enemies from attacking from one side. Some villages and towns gained even more protection by being built on the inside of river meanders or on an island in a river. Water from the river could also be used by people and animals for drinking and it could be used to water food crops. The soil near rivers is often fertile and moist so crops grew well, while fish from rivers could be used for food. Many people used rivers to travel along because the early roads were poor.


Geography T D 3 M

Activity 
Many of the world’s greatest cities are close to rivers. Some of these cities developed at fords, where the river was shallow and could be crossed on foot. Other cities grew where the first bridges were built over rivers. Many large ports developed at the mouths of rivers that provided sheltered harbours for ships.

Viking raids  
The first recorded Viking attack on Britain was in 789 ce. This was the start of a long, violent struggle between the Anglo-Saxons and the Vikings. At first, the Vikings raided Britain. They travelled over the North Sea in longboats and stole valuable treasures, such as gold, jewels and books. They also took food, cattle, clothes and tools.


History T D 5 M

Viking settlers  
In 865 ce, an army of Vikings arrived in Britain. This time they wanted to conquer land and settle in Britain, not just raid the country and return to their homelands. The Vikings had many reasons for choosing Britain as a place to settle. Their land at home in Denmark, Norway and Sweden was not very good for growing crops or keeping animals. This meant that, as the population grew, there was not enough food. The Vikings were searching for better, more fertile land for their farms.
