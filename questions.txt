Longshore drift  
Waves can move sand and pebbles along the shore. This happens in places where the prevailing wind blows the waves towards the shore at an angle. Instead of flowing back in the direction it came from, the water from the wave goes straight back down the beach. Any sand and pebbles carried by the waves also slowly travel along the shore in this zig-zag pattern. This movement is called longshore drift.


Geography T D 3 M

Activity  
Deposition  
When something on the coastline, such as a bay or the mouth of a river, makes the waves move more slowly, they no longer have the energy to carry sand and shingle. The waves then slow down and deposit or drop the materials they were carrying.

Mountains and temperature  
As you climb up a mountain, the weather changes. The higher you go, the colder it gets. The temperature falls by about 2 degrees Celsius for each 300 metres you climb. If you climb high enough, you will eventually reach the snow line. Above this height, it is so cold that snow covers the ground even in summer. This is why there is snow on the tops of very high mountains near the Equator.


Geography T D 3 M

Activity  
What is a rain shadow?  
The upper parts of mountains are often covered in clouds. Clouds are made up of tiny water droplets. Mountains cause the clouds to rise so high that the droplets join together. The bigger drops fall as rain or snow. Often the rain or snow falls on only one side of the mountain, called the windward side. The other side of the mountain, the leeward side, which receives much less rain or snow, is said to be in a rain shadow.

Mountain weather and land use  
The Sun affects the different sides of a mountain differently. One side may be in sunshine and the other in shadow. Also, because cold air is heavier than warm air, it tends to sink into the valleys. That is why orchards of fruit trees are planted on the lower slopes of a mountain and not in the bottom of a valley. Villages are often built on the lower slopes of a mountain too, rather than in the colder valley bottom.

Many early towns and villages were built near rivers because the rivers stopped enemies from attacking from one side. Some villages and towns gained even more protection by being built on the inside of river meanders or on an island in a river. Water from the river could also be used by people and animals for drinking and it could be used to water food crops. The soil near rivers is often fertile and moist so crops grew well, while fish from rivers could be used for food. Many people used rivers to travel along because the early roads were poor.


Geography T D 3 M

Activity 
Many of the world’s greatest cities are close to rivers. Some of these cities developed at fords, where the river was shallow and could be crossed on foot. Other cities grew where the first bridges were built over rivers. Many large ports developed at the mouths of rivers that provided sheltered harbours for ships.

Learning Objectives  
to identify the different types of information available on maps  
to recognise the different ways in which information is presented on maps.  


Social Studies T D 4 M

Information Features on a Map  
Maps use a number of features such as text, signs and symbols to provide information.  
Maps usually have a title. This describes the location of the area covered by the map and may say what type of information the map shows.  
Maps show direction. Most maps have a north pointer or a compass rose to show direction. If there is no such sign then it is assumed that north is at the top of the map.  
Maps have a key. Labelling everything on a map would make it difficult to read. To avoid this, maps have signs and symbols drawn on them and a key which explains what the signs and symbols mean.  
Maps are also drawn at different scales. The scale on a map is the link between a measurement on a map and the real distance on the ground.

Medical co-operation means that:  
● the available resources will be well used  
● health services are planned and provided in similar ways across the region  
● the health services save money  
● medicines and medical equipment can be bought in greater quantities, and therefore at a better price.  

Another good reason for neighbouring countries to work together is that illnesses and diseases, and the insects and other animals that sometimes carry them, do not confine themselves within the borders of a country. Medical co-operation is essential in combating diseases and controlling their spread. Countries can help one another by putting in place suitable processes for detection, monitoring, prevention and treatment.

Social Studies T D 5 M

[Text]
Regional co-operation happens when separate countries in a region work together and co-operate. They do this because they recognise that there are many situations in which more can be achieved by countries working together rather than alone. For example, they can work together on joint projects in different areas of life, or make sure the work they are doing is co-ordinated. When countries co-operate they sometimes make it easier for people and goods to move across their borders.

Review
 what is meant by the term ‘consumer’  
 some choices that consumers can make.  
Choosing based on price  
When people set out to buy goods and services they find that more than one person is selling those goods and offering those services. If the goods or services being offered are exactly the same, the consumer can make a choice based on the price that is being asked. In this case the consumer will probably buy the ones that are cheapest.  
Choosing based on value for money  
Sometimes a consumer has to decide between goods and services that are similar but not exactly the same. Some of these may be cheaper than others but that does not make them the best ones to buy. Other goods and services may be more expensive but they may also be of a higher quality. More expensive services may be of a higher standard.

 about natural resources found in the Arabian Gulf.


Social Studies T D 3 M

Activities
 Land and water are very valuable resources in Arabian Gulf countries. Some land is used for building towns and cities. Some land must also be used to provide food. Water is needed for people to drink but it is also vital for agriculture. 

Much of the water used by people in the region comes from the sea. The salt must be taken out of it first. This process is called desalination.

Most of the trees grown in Arabian Gulf countries are for food, such as dates and citrus fruits, rather than for timber. Another important product is frankincense. It is made from the resin of certain trees which grow in Oman and Yemen. It is valuable because of its lovely smell and has been traded around the world for thousands of years. Mangroves grow in the salt marshes found in some places on the coast and they make important animal habitats.

Social Studies T D 6 M

[Text]  
The need for more resources  
During this period many European countries were experiencing a period of industrialisation. This process saw a number of new inventions and industrial processes that made it possible to produce goods rapidly on a very large scale. This huge increase in the rate and speed of production meant that there was a much greater demand for resources. To keep up with their rivals each country needed to keep the factories running. To access the resources to achieve this, the countries set about taking control of the territories where these resources were found. These territories also provided new markets for the goods being produced.


Social Studies T D 6 M

[Text]  
The need for new resources  
Many new materials were being discovered and their uses explored. Many of these resources, such as oil, rubber and certain metals, were not available in Europe, and so they had to be obtained from abroad.


Social Studies T D 6 M

[Text]  
Strategic positions  
Lands were sometimes occupied for strategic reasons. In a time before air travel, the fact that one country bordered another one was very significant. Countries acted as buffers between the neighbouring countries on either side. Some colonies were occupied by one nation to prevent a rival nation spreading too far. Other lands were occupied because they were in a good position to offer protection or control of trading routes.

C’était un beau jour d’été, le soleil transperçait les rideaux de la chambre et, on pouvait sentir la douce chaleur du petit matin. Il était difficile de continuer à ignorer le chant des oiseaux et des criquets, l’aboiement du chien et le brouhaha des habitants de la maison. Martin soupira avec regret, et éjecta sa couverture d’un coup de pied. Il bailla et se frotta les yeux avant de quitter son lit. Il jeta un coup d’œil à son réveil et grogna de mécontentement quand il remarqua qu’il s’était réveillé beaucoup plus tôt qu’il n’avait prévu. -Et moi qui voulais faire la grasse matinée … marmonna-t-il. Il alla faire sa toilette et, avant de se brosser les dents, laissa échapper un sourire moquer en voyant son reflet. Ses cheveux était tout ébouriffés ! … Il avait même un peu de bave qui dégoulinait du bout de sa bouche. Une fois propre il se dirigea vers la cuisine pour prendre son petit déjeuner. Il y avait une délicieuse odeur dans toute la maison et même s’il ne savait pas de quoi il s’agissait, il en voulait une grosse part. En entrant, il entendit sa mère et son grand frère chuchoter puis les vit. Maman se tenait debout en face de la cuisinière et Lucas était assis sur le comptoir à côté d’elle. -J’ai économisé assez d’argent pendant les trois dernières années. N’oublie pas que je travaillais aussi pendant l’été, disait Lucas. Il avait la tête inclinée envers Maman et lui jetait un regard suppliant . Maman lui lança un regard douteux avant de retourner son attention vers la poêle. Elle retourna une crêpe avant de poser sa spatule puis questionna Lucas : -Mais est-ce que tu crois que ça va te suffire pour acheter une voiture ? C’est plutôt cher comme engin tu sais… -Oui ! Une petite voiture d’occasion , je n’ai pas besoin d’une voiture neuve dès le début. Le grand frère répondit. Lorsque sa mère ne dit rien, Lucas ajouta : - S’il te plait Maman, je viens d’avoir mon bac . Je ne vais quand même pas vous demander de me conduire à l’Université tous les jours lors de la rentrée  ! Et puis, ce n’est pas comme si vous deviez conduire Martin au collège non plus puisqu’il est en vacances. Papa a plus de temps libre maintenant. Maman laissa échapper un soupir puis sourit indulgemment  : – D’accord, je vais en parler à ton père, Acquiesça-t-elle , mais la décision lui revient. Lucas hocha la tête avec un sourire et embrassa Maman sur la joue en la remerciant. –C’est tous ce que je te demande. Dit-il. Martin se doutant de ce qui se passait, décida de confirmer ses soupçons. -Qu’est ce qu’il y a ? Il dit d’un ton nonchalant , en sortant une boite de jus du réfrigérateur. - Bonjours chéri, Ton frère veut apprendre à conduire . Elle répondit. Papa avait accepter de donner des cours de conduite à Lucas. Tous les jours, ils sortaient l’après-midi, passaient environ deux heures dehors puis rentraient de mauvaise humeur . Papa et Lucas étaient clairement contrariés après les fameux cours de conduite et Martin se demanda ce qui pouvait bien se passer pour qu’ils soient aussi fâchés , ce qui le poussa à demander de les accompagner pour la prochaine leçon. -Je m’ennuis, ça me tente de venir avec vous, dit-il en guise d’excuse pendant qu’ils dînaient. -Même si ce n’est que pour un jour. Ajoutât-t-il. Lucas acquiesça d’un haussement d’épaule , et Martin vu maman qui fixait lourdement Papa, le poussant à accepter sa demande. C’était décidé, Martin allait partir avec eux ! Le lendemain, Martin s’installa sur la banquette arrière , et mit sa ceinture de sécurité . Il observa silencieusement Papa s’asseyant en avant et Lucas au volant . Ce dernier ajusta son siège ainsi que les rétroviseurs avant de mettre le contact . Environ une heure et demie après, le trio rentra à la maison. Papa et Lucas étaient fâchés comme les derniers jours et Martin avait l’air pensif. Il avait compris la cause de leur conflit. Papa n’est pas un bon enseignant. Il n’était pas du tout patient, et Lucas n’appréciait pas ses directives et commentaires dits sur un ton irrité. Ayant pitié de son grand frère, Martin décida de lui suggérer une solution d’une manière subtile. Il alla s’asseoir à côté de lui sur le canapé et laissa s’écouler quelques minutes avant de commencer à parler. -Ce n’est pas vraiment simple de conduire avec Papa, hein ? Dit-il avec un sourire compatissant . -Ouai, c’est le moins qu’on puisse dire… Lucas répondit en levant les yeux au ciel . -J’avais la même impression lorsqu’il m’apprenait les tables de multiplication au primaire, heureusement que j’avais réglé le problème rapidement. Lucas, intrigué par les paroles de son petit frère, se tortilla un peu avant de glisser un peu plus près de Martin. Il s’éclaircit la gorge et demanda d’une voix basse  : - Et comment t’as fait ? Martin le regarda d’un air complice et lui dit : -J’ai demandé à Maman de le faire à sa place. Elle est beaucoup plus patiente et douce . Lucas lui lança un regard douteux puis fronça les sourcils . -Je pense que Maman est trop occupée pour m’apprendre à conduire. -Alors aides-la avec ses corvées . Martin rétorqua . Lucas hocha la tête mais ne dit rien. Il y eut un long moment de silence avant que le frère aîné ne pinçât la joue de Martin, le remerciant pour son conseil. -Lorsque j’aurai mon permis , je t’emmènerai au parc d’attraction chaque semaine ! Lui dit il excité. Martin s’en doutait mais il sourit quand même, ravi d’avoir pu aider son grand-frère. Quelques jours après, la paix et l’harmonie étaient de retour à la maison. Lucas avait commencé à faire le linge et à laver la vaisselle, accordant plus de temps libre à Maman et par conséquent , plus de temps pour lui apprendre à conduire. Après le changement d’enseignants, Lucas fit beaucoup plus de progrès et s’inscrit peu après pour passer son permis. Au bout de quelques mois, la famille exprimait sa fierté tandis que Lucas les conduisait à un restaurant dans lequel ils comptaient célébrer sa réussite à avoir son permis. -C’est grâce aux cours de conduite que je lui ai donné, dit Papa avec un sourire orgueilleux . Les 3 autres ne dirent rien mais levèrent les yeux au ciel. Enfin, tous sauf Lucas qui devait garder les yeux sur la route !

Un matin, alors qu’il était assis devant la fenêtre, le visage crispé , Lucien lâcha un soupir en voyant le temps qu’il faisait. Cela allait faire bientôt une semaine qu’il pleuvait à torrents et ça l’agaçait énormément . Il tourna vers ses camarades de garderie et les regarda avec curiosité. Comment pouvaient-ils continuer à jouer avec une telle indifférence ? C’est comme si ils s’étaient résignés à l’ennui , un truc qu’il ne pouvait accomplir. Il jeta un dernier regard hors de la fenêtre , à l’aire de jeux qui se tenait sous la pluie, et haussa les épaules. Tant pis , il n’aura qu’à penser à autre chose pour faire passer le temps . Il regarda autour de lui et vit Damien qui jouait avec les petits soldats . Il se dirigea vers lui et lui tapota l’épaule . Une fois qu’il eut son attention, il lui dit qu’il en avait assez de rester à l’intérieur sans rien faire d’amusant. -On peut jouer à cache-cache avec les autres, si tu veux ? Damien lui suggéra. Lucien n’était pas vraiment intéressé au vieux jeu. Il voulait vivre une aventure, sentir la joie et l’excitation de l’inconnu . -Non… Il prit une pause, réfléchit pour un moment puis dit à Damien : -J’ai une meilleur idée. Aide-moi à rassembler les autres . Lorsque tout le monde fut réuni, Lucien leur demanda de s’asseoir en cercle puis commença à parler avec un ton sérieux. -On va jouer au village maudit . Il leur annonça. Il s’agit d’un village envahi par les ogres et les sorcières . Les villageois doivent se cacher et éviter de se faire attraper par les ogres pour enfin aller au châteaux et alerter les soldats et sauver le village, Lucien montra les soldats que Damien avait aligné puis continua. -Ils doivent souvent changer de cachette car les ogres peuvent les renifler s’ils restent dans le même endroit trop longtemps. Et quoi qu’il arrive , ils ne doivent jamais laisser une sorcière leur mettre la main dessus. Il expliqua avant de désigner à chacun son rôle. -Pierre, Éloïse et Manon sont les ogres, -Hé ! Mais je ne veux pas être une ogresse ! Manon protesta. -C’est comme ça. Tu seras la princesse dans la prochaine partie. Lucien lui dit. La fillette, étant la plus jeune du groupe et donc la plus naïve, ne s’était pas rendu compte qu’il n’y avait pas de princesse dans le jeu, et se contenta de jouer le rôle de l’ogresse pour le moment, permettant à Lucien de continuer. -Damien, moi et Sabine sommes les villageois. Sabine, confuse par l’affectation des rôles lui demanda qui joueront les rôles des sorcières puisque tout le monde avait déjà un rôle. Lucien se pencha envers le groupe d’enfant et dit d’une voix basse et menaçante : -Les sorcières… c’est les aides maternelles  ! Le groupe laissa échapper quelques exclamations et cris de surprises avant de se lever et partir assumer leurs positions. Les ogres dormirent pendant que les villageois allèrent se cacher. Lucien se plongea dans le monde qu’il venait de créer. Désormais, sa crèche ressembla aux bois médiéval qu’on trouve dans les comptes de fées et lui-même devint vêtu d’un pantalon moulant marron et d’une cotte-hardie verte et chaussé d’une paire de bottes usées. Il courra, essoufflé, et se cacha derrière un arbre. Il jeta un coup d’œil furtif pour voir si les ogres s’étaient réveillés et vit qu’en effet, ils l’étaient. Il les guetta et les vit en train de marcher dans de différentes directions en s’arrêtant pour chercher derrière des arbres ou à l’intérieur des grottes . A un moment, lorsqu’il vit que les ogres lui tournaient le dos, il fila à toute vitesse pour changer d’abri . Son cœur battait la chamade et il était trempé de sueur lorsqu’il s’accroupit derrière un buisson . Il écarta son feuillage et vit Damien qui essayait de se faufiler derrière les grandes bêtes mais, par malchance, celui-ci ne vit pas la pièce de lego -plutôt la branche qui était sur son chemin et marcha dessus, alertant les ogres de sa présence. Lucien, souhaitant sauver son ami, prit une des baies du buisson et la jeta sur l’ogre qui était le plus proche de Damien, détournant son attention et permettant à l’autre villageois de s’enfuir à temps. Lucien profita de la confusion pour changer, lui aussi, de cachette. Il grimpa sur un arbre et regarda du haut de son perchoir pour voir comment les autres s’en sortaient. Damien se tenait debout derrière un arbre, inaperçu par les ogres, et Sabine tentait de changer de cachette mais sans succès. Lorsqu’elle se jeta enfin dans la gueule du loup , la plus jeune ogresse lui mit la main dessus. Navré par le sort de sa voisine, Lucien secoua la tête avant de se rappeler qu’il devait changer de cachette avant qu’il ne se fasse repérer. En se dirigeant vers un autre arbre, il vit du coin de son œil que Damien aussi s’était fait capturer. Malgré sa tristesse, il savait qu’il devait continuer, ne serait-ce que pour sauver le village. Trois contre un, ses chances de survie étaient minces , mais il refusait de renoncer à sa quête . Alors, il respira profondément avant de foncer vers les soldats. Il était si proche ! Il allait y arriver ! Ses jambes ne le tenaient plus, ses poumons brûlaient et le vent soufflait contre lui mais rien ne l’arrêta. À deux pas des soldats, il heurta un grand mur qui apparut de nulle part . L’impact le lança à terre et il entendit Sabine s’exclamer : - Non ! La sorcière l’a eue ! Expulsé de son monde fantastique, Lucien fit un petit sourire penaud à son institutrice avant de s’excuser. -Ce n’est pas grave. Dit-t-elle avec un sourire. -Je suis venue vous chercher pour le déjeuner. Il y a une soupe de citrouille dans le chaudron qui n’attend que vous !

Margot mangeait son petit déjeuner avec appétit. Contente de recevoir une visite de son grand père, elle s’était réveillée de bonne humeur se matin. Grand père était le membre de la famille qu’elle préférait, son meilleur ami parmi les adultes, et elle adorait passer du temps avec lui. Hier soir lorsqu’il lui a annoncé sa visite imminente au téléphone, il lui avait promis un cadeau et elle était surexcitée. D’ailleurs, elle avait des difficultés a se couché tellement elle était émoustillée . Grand père arriva à 10h du matin. Il embrassa Maman et Papa avant de prendre Margot dans ses bras. -Et comment va ma petite fille préférée ? Il demanda, ses yeux chaleureux regardant Margot avec tendresse . Margot rigola et dit avec humour : -Je suis ta seule petite fille, grand père ! Et je vais très bien, merci ! Ensuite elle ajouta : -Et comment va mon grand-père préféré ? Grand père, pris par surprise par l’espièglerie de Margot, laissa échapper un rire avant de lui assurer que, lui aussi, allait très bien. -Mais je sais qu’il y a quelque chose que tu veux avoir plus que mes nouvelles , hein ? dit Grand père avec un air taquin . Margot ne sut comment répondre, elle se tortilla un peu avant de le regarder avec ses grands yeux innocents, mais grand père n’était pas dupe , il la posa par terre et ils se dirigèrent tout les deux vers le canapé . Assis l’un à coté de l’autre, Margot regardait grand père plonger sa main dans un sac en papier avant d’en sortir un petit pot en argile contenant une plante épineuse . Margot pencha la tête par curiosité et scruta la plante que son grand père avait posé sur la petite table en face d’eux. -C’est ta surprise ma chérie. J’espère qu’elle te plaît. lui dit-Il. -C’est quoi ? répondit-elle, tout en se mettant à genoux devant la table pour regarder la plante de plus près. -Et bien, c’est une plante. Un Cactus, pour être plus précis. Grand père répondit avec amusement. Margot hocha la tête avec grand intérêt . Un moment plus tard, elle étendit sa main pour toucher la plante ronde mais son élan fit interrompu par grand père, qui lui attrapa la main avant qu’elle n’ait pu la toucher. –Attention à ne pas te faire piquer . Il dit, en indiquant les petites épines qui recouvrait la surface du cactus. -Qu’est ce que je suis sensée faire avec ? Dit Margot, toujours sans quitter la plante qui la fascinait des yeux. -T’en occuper et le faire pousser . Est-ce que ça te tente  ? -Oui, je veux bien essayer ! Une fois grand père rentré chez lui, Margot emmena la plante dans sa chambre. Elle l’installa devant sa fenêtre et l’admira dans son nouvel entourage. Se rappelant que son grand père lui avait dit qu’elle devait s’en occuper et sachant que Papa arrosait toujours les plantes du balcon , Margot décida de faire la même chose. Elle alla chercher un verre d’eau et le versa dans le pot, autour de la plante. -Je vais te donner à boire tous les jours ! Dit-elle au petit cactus. Satisfaite, elle alla faire sa toilette avant d’aller au lit. Pendant les jours qui suivit, Margot arrosait son cactus régulièrement, elle s’assurait qu’il eut assez de soleil et elle aérait sa chambre tous les matins. Elle demandait aussi à son père d’enlever les petits insectes et parasites qui se posaient sur sa petite plante adorée qu’elle cultivait avec amour. Cependant , malgré ses efforts, son petit cactus commença à perdre son éclat . Sa belle couleur verte devint pale et Margot sut qu’il se portait mal. Elle se rappela de ce qui était arrivé aux plantes que son père avait négligé lorsqu’ils étaient partis en vacances l’an dernier. Refusant de laisser son cactus mourir, Margot redoubla d’effort. Elle commença à l’arroser deux fois par jours et elle l’emmena au balcon pour lui garantir plus de soleil et d’air frais mais, malheureusement, cela ne changea rien et l’état de sa plante s’empira . Désespérée, Margot passa un coup de fil à Grand Père pour lui dire ce qui se passait. -Mon cactus est en train de mourir , pourtant j’en ai pris bien soin ! Elle cria, les larmes aux yeux. Son grand père lui demanda de lui dire comment elle en prenait soin, espérant d’identifier ce qui a bien pu contrarier la petite plante. Margot prit le temps de lui raconter sa routine et une fois qu’elle avait fini son récit , grand père lui dit : -Je suis désolé ma puce , je t’ai donné le cactus mais j’ai négligé de t’expliquer comment t’en occuper. Vois-tu, un cactus est différent des autres plantes. Il ne demande pas beaucoup d’eau. En fait, tu as seulement besoin de l’arroser une fois par semaine. En l’arrosant chaque jour, c’est comme si tu le noyais et les racines deviennent pourries par conséquence. -Et donc, qu’est-ce que je dois faire maintenant  ? demanda-t-elle. -Ne fais rien. Je viens te voir demain. On va enlever la partie pourrie s’il y en a et on va rempoter ton cactus dans du terreau sec . Allez, sèche tes larmes ma petite tout va bien se passer. Margot, rassurée par les mots de son grand père, cessa de pleurer . Elle le remercia avant de raccrocher et répéta les mots de son grand père a la petite plante : -Tout ira bien, on va te sauver. Le lendemain, grand père tint sa parole et arriva chez Margot le matin. Il avait apporté un pot neuf et un sac de terreau spéciale cactus. Margot le regarda avec attention. Elle le vit retirer la plante de son pot actuel, enlever le terreau boueux des racines avant d’en couper une grande partie. Ensuite, il mit des cailloux dans le fond du nouveau pot avent d’y verser du terreau. Il posa le cactus au centre avant de se tapoter les mains pour se débarrasser du terreau qu’il y avait sur elles. -Voilà, cela devrait faire l’affaire. Dit grand père. Avant de partir, il donna quelques astuces à Margot. Il lui dit de ne pas arroser la plante pour trois semaines et il lui suggéra de la faire tourner un petit peu chaque jour pour faire en sorte que toutes ses parties reçoivent leur part de soleil. Un mois plus tard, Margot, assise en face de sa fenêtre, chuchota à la petite plante qui avait retrouvé son éclat : -Tu vois, je t’ai bien dit qu’on allait te sauver !

C’était un beau jour, ensoleillé , frais et calme. Le chien des Dupont était dans un coin de la cuisine, étendu sur son ventre , la tête posée sur le sol entre ses pattes . Il était en train d’ignorer Solène, sa jeune maîtresse qui avait encore eu une crise de colère en ce moment-là à cause du contenu de sa gamelle , et essayait de dormir un peu après avoir lui-même vidé le contenu de la sienne . -Non, je n’en veux pas ! Cria la jeune fille en poussant son assiette loin d’elle. Solène Dupont était une petite fille âgée de sept ans. Ses parents et sa grande sœur l’adoraient et ils faisaient tout pour la rendre heureuse. Elle aussi aimait beaucoup sa famille ainsi que son chien, mais les trouvait parfois frustrant, comme lorsqu’ils l’obligeaient à mettre quelque chose qu’elle n’aimait pas ou à ranger sa chambre ou bien à manger quelque chose qui ne lui plaisait pas, comme était le cas ce jour-là. -Mais pourquoi donc ? Sa Maman interrogea d’un ton exaspéré. Mme Dupont pensa absentement qu’il n’était pas aussi difficile d’élever sa fille aînée avant de retourner son attention vers Solène. -Parce que. Elle croisa les bras avec un regard grincheux et méprisant . C’est dégueulasse les brocolis ! Même grande sœur n’en mange pas ! Répondit Solène en tournant la tête vers sa sœur aînée. La grande sœur en question leva la tête avec surprise mais ne dit rien. Elle était bien trop sage pour s’impliquer dans les moments de rages de sa petite sœur gâtée. Elle regarda sa mère avec commisération , lui souhaitant silencieusement bonne chance. -C’est parce qu’elle est allergique aux brocolis, tu le sais très bien. Maman rétorqua. -Et moi je ne trouve pas ça bon du tout ! Je ne vais pas en manger ! Et tu ne peux pas m’obliger. Dit Solène d’un ton qui indiqua que sa décision était définitive et qu’elle ne changera pas d’avis quoi qu’il arrive. Mme Dupont le savait bien, d’ailleurs elle n’avait pas du tout envie d’obliger sa fille à faire quoi que ce soit. Mais parfois c’était nécessaire. Fatiguée par ce qui se passait, elle soupira. Ce n’était pas la première fois que sa benjamine refusait de manger un plat purement par caprice , sans même y goûter . Mais elle finissait toujours par changer d’avis. Il suffisait juste de trouver une ruse pour la convaincre . -Papa adore les brocolis, il en mange tout le temps… Elle essaya. Sachant que sa fille aimait imiter son père dans presque tout ce qu’il fait, peut être que cette fois si elle le fera. Solène haussa les épaules, pas du tout impressionnée. -Et alors ? Les adultes mangent plein de trucs dégoûtants  ! Il aime aussi les cornichons , les anchois et les oignons, beurk  ! Amusée par les mots de sa fille, Maman sourit avant de reprendre un air sérieux. -D’accord, ça ne te plaît pas, je comprends … Elle prit une pause pour penser à autre chose avant de décider de régler le problème avec une approche différente. Et si on faisait un marché , toi et moi ? dit-elle posément . Solène ne dit rien mais était clairement intéressée, sa posture devint moins rigide et elle lança un regard attentif à maman, la poussant à élaborer . -Pendant cette semaine, je vais cuisiner des plats au brocoli. Je te demande seulement d’en prendre une bouchée et si ça ne te plaît toujours pas, je ne vais plus jamais te demander d’en prendre dans ton assiette. Après avoir dit cela, Maman tendit la main à sa fille pour conclure le marché . Solène la regarda avec un air incertain pour un moment, elle prit le temps de considérer ce que venait de suggérer sa mère avant de décider qu’une bouché de brocoli chaque jour pendant une semaine était un prix plutôt raisonnable à payer si elle ne lui demandera plus jamais d’en prendre après. Elle acquiesça et lui serra la main avec un sourire arrogant, convaincu qu’elle avait remporté une victoire, puis, lui demanda de passer au dessert. Le lendemain, Solène se mit à table à midi et Maman lui servit son déjeuner. Elle mit devant elle un bol de soupe et une assiette qui contenait une sorte de gratin . L’odeur était alléchante et Solène eut l’eau à la bouche . -Soupe aux poireaux et Gratin aux brocolis et au fromage pour aujourd’hui. Maman lui dit avec un sourire avant de l’embrasser sur la tempe . -Bon appétit. La petite fille fronça les sourcilles en entendant le mot « brocolis » et se demanda comment quelque chose tellement pas bon pouvait sentir aussi délicieux. Le plat qui lui parut très appétissant avant, avait l’air monstrueux maintenant qu’elle en connaissait les ingrédients. -Rappel-toi que tu m’as promis d’y goûter ! Allez, ça ne va pas te tuer  ! Maman lui dit avant de se mettre elle-même à table. -Oui, Maman. Solène dit avec désenchantement . Une promesse est une promesse et elle comptait tenir la sienne. Elle prit sa fourchette , joua un peu avec sa nourriture pour retarder l’inévitable avant de se résigner à en prendre un morceau . Elle s’attendait à quelque chose d’écœurant mais à sa surprise, ce qu’elle mangeait n’était pas si mal . Pas mal du tout… c’était même un peu bon. -Alors, qu’en penses-tu ? Lui demanda sa Maman après quelques minutes de silence. -Ce n’est pas complètement mauvais ... dit Solène avant de reprendre une autre bouchée. Mme Dupont, contente que son plan fut un succès, laissa échapper un sourire et commença à manger elle aussi. Au long de la semaine, elle cuisinait plein de plats à base de brocoli : quiche aux brocolis et au poulet, poêlée de légumes, brocolis sautés à la crème fraîche, etc. et Solène finissait toujours son assiette même si elle regardait cette dernière d’un air douteux avant de commencer à manger. Lorsque la semaine prit fin , Maman demanda à sa fille si elle voulait toujours abandonner les brocolis à jamais. Solène fit semblant de penser à sa réponse mais finit par dire qu’elle ne les détestait pas autant après tout.

Lily leva la tête vers le ciel et ronronna avec contentement lors qu’elle sentit la chaleur des rayons du soleil lui envelopper le corps. Elle se leva lentement de sa position allongée et s’étira . Samedi était le jour favori de la chatonne car sa propriétaire , Sarah, passait presque toute la journée à la maison. Elle en prenait soin, la chouchoutait et lui donnait plein de gâteries . Ce samedi était particulièrement agréable car on pouvait clairement sentir l’arrivée du printemps . -C’était une bonne sieste . Dit-elle absentement en se dirigeant vers sa fontaine à eau dans le couloir . Elle jeta un coup d’œil à sa gamelle de croquettes et fut ravie de voir qu’elle était pleine . Elle lapa un peu d’eau avant d’aller s’installer sur son panier . Elle commença à se lécher lentement et avec précision. Elle prenait soin de le faire tous les jours pour garder son beau pelage blanc propre et brillant. Mais, au bout d’un moment, elle remarqua qu’elle perdait plus de poils que d’habitude. En effet, elle avait dû s’éclaircir la gorge en se débarrassant d’une boule de poil pour continuer sa toilette, deux fois de suite ! Avec horreur, elle en déduit qu’elle est en train de devenir chauve. Cela était la seule explication pour ce qui se passait. Dévastée, elle ne put s’empêcher de penser au fait qu’elle deviendra moche une fois tous ses poils tombés, et se dit que Sarah ne l’aimerai plus et qu’elle la jettera dehors. L’idée lui brisa le cœur et elle décida de partir avant qu’elle ne soit forcée à faire face à l’inévitable. Elle alla voir Sarah qui faisait sa sieste et la regarda tendrement avant de partir la queue entre les pattes . Une fois dehors , elle ne sut pas trop où aller ni quoi faire. Elle avait passé toute sa vie chez Sarah et elle n’avait aucune idée sur ce qu’elle était sensé faire pour survivre dans la nature... ou plutôt dans les jungles de ciments qui formaient la cité. Pour le moment, elle décida d’errer sans but. Pendant qu’elle trottait au long de la rue , sa mélancolie s’effaça pour faire place à sa curiosité. Elle regarda les bâtiments , les humains, les magasins et les quelques espaces verts qui décoraient la cité. Une odeur délicieuse l’attira vers la façade d’un restaurant de grillades et elle sentit son estomac vide protester et regretta de ne pas avoir mangé quelques croquettes avant de sortir. Elle miaula pitoyablement. Fatiguée, affamée et terrifiée par cette grande ville sans fin, et ne s’arrêta que lorsqu’elle sentit la langue d’un autre chat sur sa joue . Elle tourna la tête brusquement pour voir qui été venu pour la réconforter et vit une vielle chatte de gouttière. Probablement une chatte errante aussi vu qu’elle ne portait pas de collier . -Tu as faim, je présume ? Dit la vielle féline avec une douce voix. -O-oui... lui répondit Lily timidement. -Viens avec moi. Il y aura de bons morceaux de viande dans l’allée dans peu de temps. Dégoûtée par l’idée de manger le contenu d’une poubelle , Lily fit une grimace qui fit sourire la vielle chatte avec amusement. -Ne t’inquiète pas. Les cuisiniers de ce restaurants nous laissent souvent les restent sur des assiettes en mousse ou des boites en carton . La nourriture est propre. Rassurée, Lily la suivit et s’installa avec elle au pied de l’escalier de secoure du bâtiment qui côtoyait le restaurant. La vielle chatte lui dit qu’elle s’appelait Agathe et Lily se présenta en retour. Tandis qu’elles attendaient l’arrivé de leur repas , une autre chatte et deux petits chatons les rejoignèrent. La maman les salua alors que les deux petits continuèrent à jouer ensemble. -On a de la compagnie aujourd’hui ? demanda la nouvelle arrivée à Agathe. -En effet. Cleo je te présente Lily. Agathe répondit avant de dire à Lily que les deux chattons s’appelaient Max et Lu. Un moment après, un des humains du restaurant leur ramena des morceaux de viande grillée dans une boite en carton et les caressa un peu avant de retourner à l’intérieur pour les laisser manger en paix. Une fois rassasiées , le groupe de chats se dirigea vers un pont pour passer la nuit en dessous. Telle était leur routine quotidienne , ils traversaient la cité pour aller manger puis retournaient s’abriter sous le pont. Au bout de quelques jours, lorsqu’ils étaient en route, Lily s’arrêta devant un lampadaire et regarda une affiche avec un air triste. -Qu’est ce qu’il y a ? interrogea Agathe qui n’avait pas encore vu l’affiche et Lily la lui indiqua d’un mouvement de sa tête. -Oh ! C’est toi ! Agathe dit et Lily hocha sa tête. -C’est ma propriétaire, Sarah, qui a dû mettre ces affiches… Elle me manque tellement. -Pourquoi l’as-tu quitté alors ? -Parce que je ne voulais pas qu’elle me mette dehors. Cria Lily. -Pourquoi te mettrait-elle dehors ? Si elle ne voulait pas de toi elle ne se serait sans doute pas donnée la peine de coller ces affiches. -Une fois que j’aurai perdue tous mes poils, elle n’aurait plus voulu de moi. Dit Lily en baissant la tête. -Comment ça ? Tes poils m’ont l’air en parfait état . -Non ! Je suis en train de les perdre! La semaine dernière j’ai constaté que j’en perdais plus que d’habitude. Agathe lui donna un petit coup avec la tête. -Tu n’es pas très futée , dis donc ? Lily la regarda d’un air offensé et Agathe lui expliqua qu’il était tout à fait normal pour les chats de perdre plus de poils pendant le printemps et que contrairement à ce qu’elle pensait, elle n’était pas en train de perdre tout son pelage. -Mais bon, tu es jeune donc je crois que c’est la première fois pour toi. Dit la vielle chatte en haussant les épaules. -Rentre chez toi, je suis sûre que tu manques beaucoup à ta Sarah. Ajouta-t-elle. Maintenant, rassurée qu’elle n’est pas en train de perdre son plus beau trait, Lily ne perdit plus de temps. Elle remercia Agathe et Cleo et courra retrouver sa propriétaire et sa maison. Sarah l’accueilli avec les larmes aux yeux et plein de câlins et de friandises .

A. Pour le mouiller

Après avoir fini de ranger sa chambre, Alexandre, satisfait par son accomplissement et réjoui par le beau temps qu’il faisait, décida qu’il méritait une récompense . Il passa quelques minutes à penser à quelque chose qui lui ferait plaisir et que maman ne lui refuserait pas. Il décida alors de profiter du beau temps et de passer le reste de la journée dehors. Il alla alors chercher Maman et la trouva dans le salon en train de passer l’aspirateur . Il se tint droit et attendit jusqu’à ce qu’elle débrancha l’engin pour passer à un autre coin de la pièce puis, il l’appela. -Maman ? -Oui, mon chéri ? Maman lui répondit avec un sourire. C’était un bon signe. Il n y avait pas de grandes chances de refus si elle était de bonne humeur . -J’ai fini de ranger ma chambre et je me disais qu’il serait bien si on allait faire un pique-nique maintenant… Alexandre dit avec un regard plaidant . Maman lui sourit tristement avant de lui dire qu’elle était trop occupée pour le moment et qu’il lui restait encore plein de corvées à faire. -S’il te plaît ! Il fait si beau dehors ! -Mais je ne peux pas laisser tout ce travail fait à moitié mon chou. Tu sais que je peux seulement nettoyer la maison pendant le week- end à cause de mon travail. Maman expliqua. -D’accord, je peux t’attendre. Quand est-ce que tu vas finir de faire le ménage  ? Maman soupira avant de céder à sa demande. -Peut être dans une heure ? … Ou moins, si je fais plus vite. Tu peux aller chercher la couverture de pique-nique et l’installer dans le jardin pendant que je termine. Tu la trouveras dans le placard . Alexandre remercia sa Maman et courra faire ce qu’elle lui avait demandé. Il lutta un peu contre la couverture qui était coincée sous les draps avant de la tirer du placard et alla au jardin pour choisir le parfait endroit où la mettre. D’abord, il pensa à la mettre près des fleurs mais changea d’avis lorsqu’il vit les abeilles qui y butinaient . Ensuite, il avait essayer de poser la couverture au centre du jardin, sur l’herbe fraîchement tendu , mais le soleil tapait trop fort. Ceci le poussa enfin à installer la couverture sous l’ombre d’un arbre et il se réjouit de voir que c’était l’endroit parfait. Une fois sa tâche accomplie, Alexandre regarda la couverture et pensa absentement que la couleur verte des carrés qui la composaient était presque la même que celle de l’herbe qui l’entourait. Pendant qu’il nota ce détail, il vit, du coin de son œil, quelques fourmis monter sur la couverture. Il les chassa, puis, s’allongea sur la couverture et se mit à admirer le ciel en attendant que sa mère le rejoigne . Bercé par les nuages qui passaient lentement, et par la douce chaleur du printemps, Alexandre s’endormit. Une petite sieste lui fera du bien avant le repas de midi . Alexandre ne sut pas combien de temps s’était écoulé avant qu’il ne se réveilla désorienté. Cependant, lorsqu’il regarda autour de lui, il se trouva dans une chambre qui ne lui était pas du tout familière. C’était une grande pièce avec du papier peint qui ressemblait à celui de chez grand-mère, un barreau en bois et une cheminée. Il jeta les draps qu’il ne reconnaissait pas par-dessus lui et tenta de quitter son lit mais sa tentative échoua et il fit une chute . Mais qu’est-ce qu’il faisait dans ce lit de géant  ! Il se leva du sol et se dirigea vers le grand balcon. Ce qu’il vit l’avait tellement surpris qu’il en avait perdu le souffle. La vue qui lui faisait face était sublime , et était composée d’une grande pleine formée de carrés qui alternait de couleur : Tantôt un vert d’herbe, tantôt un blanc de marguerite. Un peu plus loin, il vit un village avec plein de petites maisons et de chalets. Lorsqu’il avança davantage dans le balcon, il vit un jardin qui l’entourait avec un labyrinthe sur un côté, des rosiers sur l’autre et une fontaine au milieu. Curieux, il se pencha sur les rails du balcon et leva la tête pour voir à quoi ressemblait l’endroit qui avait une si belle vue. Il s’agissait d’un château . Alexandre n y comprit rien. Il décida de retourner à l’intérieur et de s’habiller pour aller découvrir où il se trouvait. Il avait à peine prit un pas lorsqu’un homme débarqua dans la chambre avec un “Bonjour, messire  !” Alexandre le regarda avec hésitation. Il voulait lui demander qui il était mais les mots le trahit et il le scruta en silence. -Je vois que quelqu’un s’est levé du mauvais pied aujourd’hui… Murmura le monsieur qui se tourna par la suite vers l’armoire et commença à fouiller dedans. -Que faites-vous ? Dit Alexandre, lorsqu’il retrouva enfin la voix. -Hmm ? Le monsieur lui fit face, pencha la tête et fronça les sourcilles . Ce que je fais chaque matin, évidement . Je vous prépare votre tenue  ! -M-ma tenue ? Ça fait presque deux ans que je m’habille tout seul ! Merci, mais je peux me débrouiller. Alexandre répondit, offensé par l’insinuation du monsieur. Non, mais ! Il le prenait pour qui ? Le monsieur devait se poser la même question, puisqu’il lui dit d’un ton sévère : -Je suis votre valet , Monsieur. C’est mon travail. Hein ?!!! (À suivre...)

1) Pourquoi Alexandre voulait-il faire un pique-nique ?

-V-Valet ? Alexandre s’écria, stupéfait par ce qu’il venait d’entendre. -C’est exact … Êtes-vous sure que vous vous sentez bien, messire ? Le monsieur lui demanda en déposant les vêtements sur le lit. -Je… n’en sais rien. Alexandre lui répondit en passant la main dans ses cheveux. Excusez-moi, mais, quel est votre nom ? -Samuel. Le valet lui dit avec un regard curieux. Je crois que vous feriez mieux de vous recoucher , messire. Vous n’êtes clairement pas dans votre assiette . Alexandre refusa mais lui dit qu’il préférerait s’habiller lui-même et lui demanda de sortir de la pièce. Une fois présentable , Alexandre sortit de sa chambre. Samuel l’attendait au bout du corridor et il s’inclina devant lui avant de lui dire qu’il allait le conduire à la salle à manger pour prendre leurs petits déjeuners. Samuel lui dit aussi qu’ils allaient partir au village pour récupérer sa nouvelle épée de chez le forgeron et Alexandre acquiesça avec incertitude. Au salon, il rencontra trois hommes qui se levèrent à son entré puis le saluèrent. Samuel lui murmura qu’ils étaient ses chevaliers . Surpris par l’information, Alexandre se demanda qui était-il dans cet univers pour vivre dans un château, avoir un valet, une épée et des chevaliers. Sa question fut résolue lorsqu’une des dames de cour entra et s’adressa à lui. -Messire, son altesse votre mère vous informe qu’elle arrivera de son voyage à temps pour vous rejoindre pour le déjeuner. Son altesse sa mère… il était donc un prince. Il tourna vers Samuel pour confirmer son hypothèse et d’une voix basse, celui-ci lui dit : - Pas seulement un prince, messire. Vous êtes le gardien du royaume du damier . Gardien du royaume du damier… Alexandre comprit que le nom du royaume venait de ses plaines, mais que voulait Samuel entendre par “gardien” ? De quoi était-t-il sensé garder le royaume ? Samuel interrompu ses pensées et lui dit qu’il est temps pour eux d’aller au village. Ensemble, les deux se dirigèrent vers les étables . Au début, l’idée de monter sur un cheval avait rendu Alexandre anxieux. Il n’avait jamais fait quelque chose de pareil et il passa quelques moments à penser à une bonne excuse pour se tirer de l’engagement. Mais, une fois en face du bel étalon noir et après l’avoir caresser un peu, il changea d’avis. Il monta sur son cheval et Samuel fit de même avec sa jument . Ils échangèrent quelques mots de temps en temps pendant qu’ils trottèrent vers leur destination et une fois arrivés, Samuel lui dit qu’il va y aller en premier pour voir si l’épée était prête . Pendant les moments qu’il passa seul, Alexandre regarda autour de lui. Il vit des villageois qui marchaient un peu partout, des vendeurs de fruits et légumes et de divers magasins. Soudain, il entendit des cris de détresse. Son cheval sursauta et faillit le faire tomber. Il tourna pour voir d’où venaient les hurlements et ses yeux s’élargirent sous l’effet de ce qu’il vit : Des fourmis géantes piétinaient le village. Samuel, attiré par le tumulte , sortit de l’atelier . -Messire ! Il cria, poussant Alexandre à faire tourner son cheval vers lui. Tenez ! Dit-t-il en lui lançant une épée. -Mais qu’est-ce que je suis sensé en faire ! Dit Alexandre en l’attrapant avec maladresse . -Utilisez-la pour chasser les fourmis ! Vous l’avez déjà fait, voyons ! -Je vous assure que non ! Je n’ai aucune idée de comment m’y prendre  ! -J’ai foi en vous, messire ! Bonne chance ! Dit Samuel avant de se sauver avec le reste des villageois. Alexandre n’eut même pas le temps de réfléchir avant qu’une fourmi lui sauta dessus. Par réflexe, il la bloqua et s’éloigna d’elle au galop. Surpris par sa capacité de brandir une épée, il la manipula et la fit tourner dans sa main un peu. -Tant pis, s’ils veulent que je sois le gardien, je vais être le gardien ! Se dit-t-il avant de retourner au champ de bataille . Bien qu’il l’ait fait avec hésitation au début, Alexandre se battit férocement et courageusement . Il lança des coups d’épée et fonça vers ses ennemies. Ses chevaliers ne tardèrent pas à le rejoindre et ensemble, ils chassèrent les fourmis hors du royaume. Les villageois, sortirent de leurs abris et les applaudirent chaleureusement . -Vive le prince ! Vive les chevaliers ! Vive le royaume du damier ! S’écriaient-t-ils avec joie. Une fois retournés dans le château, les chevaliers et Samuel s’excusèrent de la grande salle pour laisser Alexandre parler avec la reine . -Maman ! Le gardien s’écria lorsqu’il vit enfin un visage qu’il reconnaissait. Il prit quelques pas pour embrasser sa mère mais son élan fit interrompu par une soudaine sensation de vertige . La dernière chose qu’il entendit avant de perdre conscience était la voix de sa mère. -Alexandre, Alexandre, Alex!... Lorsqu’il ouvrit les yeux de nouveau, il se trouva face à face avec sa Maman. Elle lui caressait les cheveux et lui souriait. -Allez, debout petit paresseux . Tu ne veux plus faire de pique- nique ? Lui demanda-t-elle. Papa va nous rejoindre à n’importe quel moment. Il m’a appelé tout à l’heur et m’a dit qu’il avait fini de faire les courses . Alexandre prit le temps de regarder autour de lui avant de se jeter dans les bras de sa mère. Il était de retour dans son monde. Ou plutôt, il s’était réveillé de son rêve. -Maman ! Tu ne vas pas croire tes oreilles lorsque je te raconte où j’étais ni ce que j’ai fait ! Il dit avec enthousiasme. -J’ai sauvé le royaume du damier des vilaines fourmis, Maman!!! La mère d’Alexandre rigola et lui dit qu’il peut tout lui raconter pendant qu’ils déjeunassent.

Un beau jour ensoleillé, Les élèves de la garderie Le Lièvre partirent en randonnée dans le bois avec leur institutrice. Celle-ci avait choisi un itinéraire assez facile pour les tout petits et marchait à un rythme lent pour ne pas les fatiguer. -Zoé ? Clément, un des petits garçons qui marchaient en queue, appela sa sœur. -Oui ? Son aînée répondit. Zoé trouva l’activité à son goût . Depuis toute petite, elle aimait marcher, courir et sauter. C’était une fillette très active contrairement à son petit frère gâté qui préférait se faire porter et conduire par tout. -J’ai faim. Quand est-ce qu’on va manger ? Il lui demanda. -On mangera quand on arrivera aux chalets. Mademoiselle Ludivine nous l’a déjà dit. -Mais j- Avant qu’il ne put finir sa phrase, Clément trébucha sur une pierre et fit une chute. Il se redressa mais resta agenouillé et commença à gémir de douleur en s’essuyant le visage avec les mains. Zoé, exaspérée par son petit frère étourdi , soupira et s’arrêta pour l’aider à se lever. -Tu es tombé parce que tes lacets son défaits . Regarde ! Dit-elle en indiquant ses chaussures d’un mouvement de sa tête avant de lui tendre la main. -Ah ! Une minute. Je vais les refaire ! Clément, distrait par cette information, cessa de pleurer et détourna son attention vers ses lacets. Le petit garçon essaya d’accomplir sa tâche à plusieurs reprises mais échoua et lorsque sa grande sœur n’eut plus de patience, elle s’accroupit pour faire ses lacets elle-même. -Laisses-moi faire, sinon on y passera la journée . Dit-elle. Une fois ses chaussures sécurisées, Clément et sa sœur reprirent leur route pour rejoindre les autres. Mais, après une bonne dizaine de minutes de marche, ils réalisèrent qu’ils s’étaient séparés du groupe. -Ah ! Ils ont avancé drôlement vite, dis donc ! Zoé remarqua. Cependant, les deux continuèrent à marcher jusqu’à ce qu’ils arrivèrent à une bifurcation . -Tu crois qu’ils sont partis par où ? Dit-Clément. -Je n’en sais rien. Mais on doit choisir. -Je vais le faire ! Son frère lui dit. -Am stram gram. Pique et pique et colégram. Bourre et bourre et ratatam. Am stram gram! Il chanta en pointant le doigt sur les deux chemins en alternance avant de déclarer qu’ils iront à gauche. N’y voyant pas d’inconvénients, Zoé accepta et ils se remirent en route. Pendant ce temps, Clément se plaignit de la chaleur, la fatigue et la faim qu’il ressentait. Zoé l’ignora et lui dit de boire un peu d’eau en lui donnant sa gourde . Ils marchèrent silencieusement pendant quelques moments avant que Clément lui demanda encore une fois quand est-ce qu’ils arriveront à leur destination. -Je n’en sais pas plus que toi, Clément ! Lui répondit-elle. -D’ailleurs, je crois que nous sommes perdus ... Clément essaya de garder son calme. Il était sûre que du moment qu’il restait avec sa grande sœur, tout irait bien. Après tout, Zoé était tellement intelligente et courageuse , elle trouvera sûrement une solution. -Qu’est-ce qu’on va faire maintenant ? Lui demanda-t-il. -Je ne sais pas. Peut-être qu’on doit rester ici et attendre qu’on nous envoie de l’aide. Mademoiselle Ludivine finira par se rendre compte de notre absence tôt ou tard ... Zoé dit avec incertitude. Clément, désirant aider sa sœur décida de lui suggérer quelques solutions. -Peut être qu’on devrait grimper sur l’arbre le plus haut et voir si on peut repérer le camp depuis son sommet . -Ça serait trop dangereux, Clément. Soupira Zoé. -Alors, on peut continuer à marcher jusqu’au sommet de la montagne. Ça devrait faire l’affaire aussi. -On ne sait pas quel chemin prendre pour atteindre le sommet non plus... -On peut - -Non, Clément. On ne peut rien faire ! Arrête de m’agacer  ! On va rester sagement ici et attendre que quelqu’un vienne pour nous ! Zoé, cria lorsqu’elle devint à bout de patience. Clément, vexé par le ton de sa sœur, commença à pleurer. Zoé eut de la peine pour lui et regretta sa crise de colère. Elle savait bien que ce n’était pas la faute de Clément qu’il s’était perdu et elle le prit dans ses bras et lui demanda des excuses. -Aller, viens ! On va manger. Je sais que tu as faim. Lui dit-elle lorsqu’il se calma enfin. Elle le mena s’asseoir sur une souche . Les deux retirèrent leurs boites à lunch et commencèrent à en consommer le contenu. Après un moment, Clément aperçut un écureuil qui les guettait de derrière un arbre et il attira l’attention de sa sœur vers leur petit compagnon. -Je crois qu’il a faim. Dit-elle. -Maman nous a mis de la tarte aux noix de pécan , tu veux lui en offrir un peu ? Clément accepta avec enthousiasme et prit un morceau de leur dessert avant de s’approcher doucement du petit animal. L’écureuil, aussi, s’approcha doucement et commença à manger dans la main du petit garçon. Lorsque les trois firent rassasié , une voix surprit les deux enfants en disant : -Vous êtes perdus, n’est-ce pas ? Zoé et Clément regardèrent autour d’eux avant que la voix leur dit de regarder en bas. Ils furent bouches bées lorsqu’ils réalisèrent qu’elle venait du petit écureuil. -I-i-il parle ! Cria Clément. -C’est exacte. Dit écureuil avec un petit sourire espiègle . -Z-Z-Zoé!!! Il parle!!! Clément tourna vers sa sœur qui était maintenant pétrifiée. Le cerveau de la pauvre petite essayait probablement de trouver un bon raisonnement pour ce qui se passait. L’écureuil lâcha un soupir, plus ennuyé que diverti maintenant. -Mais évidemment que je parle. Tout le monde parle dans le bois enchanté ! Cela fit enfin sortir Zoé de son état de transe et elle fronça les sourcilles avant de répéter bêtement les mots de l’écureuil. -Le bois enchanté ? Dit-elle. -Comme je viens de le dire. Rétorqua l’animal. -Mais j’y pense, je ne me suis pas encore présenté. Je m’appelle Félix. Félix DuBois. Ajouta-t-il. Clément rigola. Quel jeu de mots  ! Et Zoé se présenta elle et son frère. -Pour vous remercier d’avoir si gracieusement partagé votre repas avec moi, que dites-vous si je vous conduis à votre troupeau  ? -On a un troupeau ? Chuchota-Clément à sa sœur. -Il parle de nos camarades et de Mademoiselle Ludivine. L’informa-t- elle. -Ah... -Alors ? Qu’en dites-vous ? -Oui ! Oui... on vous en serait très reconnaissants , Monsieur DuBois ! Dit-Zoé avec un sourire. -Appelez-moi Félix, Monsieur DuBois est mon père... leur dit-il avant de leurs demander de le suivre. Ils marchèrent silencieusement pour un moment, puis, Clément commença à parler avec leur guide et lui poser des questions pour satisfaire sa curiosité. -Et vous êtes sûr que vous n’avez pas de pouvoirs magiques ? Clément l'interrogea. Il lui avait posé tellement de question que Zoé en perdit le compte. -Sûr et certain, mon petit. L’écureuil répondit patiemment. -Et les autres, euh, habitants du bois? Est-ce qu’ils en ont ? -Hmm... et bien, oui. Quelques-uns. Les vieux chênes , par exemple. Ou bien même les loups et l’aigle... -Ohhh ! Ils ont quoi comme pouvoirs ? -Le vieux chêne à le pouvoir de guérison . Les animaux blessés de la forêt s’adressent à lui souvent pour demander de l’aide. Il ne dit jamais non et offre son soutien à tout le monde... certains le sollicitent aussi pour sa sagesse . C’est le plus vielle habitant de la forêt après tout. Clément l’écouta attentivement et ses yeux brillaient d’émerveillement . -L’aigle à le pouvoir de la vision. Bien plus qu’un sens, lorsqu’il est haut dans les cieux , celle-ci lui permet de tout voir et elle peut atteindre des terres lointaines . D’ailleurs, nous sommes en route pour le trouver. Il nous dira où sont vos compagnons. Continua-Félix. -Quant aux loups, ils peuvent sentir les émotions : la peur, la lâcheté et la malice. On dit qu’un loup du bois enchanté ne trahi jamais son clan car les autres membres peuvent anticiper ça trahison grâce à leurs pouvoirs et ils l’excluent hors du groupe, faisant de lui un être vulnérable et une proie facile pour les prédateurs. Ils marchèrent encore un peu avant d’atteindre la cascade sacrée. Selon Félix, c’était l’endroit où les animaux se désaltéraient. Prédateur et proie se comportent sagement dans cet endroit et il est strictement interdit à qui que ce soit d’attaquer son prochain. Ils virent des animaux de toutes sortes penchés par-dessus la rive. Certains étaient grands, d’autres petits. Une gazelle avec sa biche se reposaient sous un grand chêne et un lion de compagne buvait à quelques mètres d’elles. Clément, intimidé par ces êtres, serra la main de sa sœur et se blottit contre elle. -C’est bizarre, je ne le vois pas. Il devrait être ici. Dit-Félix. Il n’y a pas d’heure précise et tout le monde peut venir lorsque bon leur semble mais Octave vient toujours à cette heure... -Bonjours, Félix. Une louve à la fourrure blanche pure le salua. -Hélène, toujours aussi radieuse à ce que je vois. Félix dit et Clément et Zoé sourirent l’un à l’autre. -Dit moi, n’aurai-tu pas vu Octave par hasard  ? -Ah, j’ai entendu dire qu’il allait mal. Tu le trouveras sûrement sur l’une des branches du vieux chêne. Félix la remercia et les dirigea vers l’arbre sous lequel la gazelle était assise. -Bonjours, Aristide. Nous cherchons Octave et on nous a dit qu’il est près de toi. -Bonjours, Félix et petits humains. Une voix masculine répondit à l’écureuil. Octave n’est pas en très bon état en ce moment. Il dort dans une de mes cavités. Puis-je vous aider à sa place  ? Félix hésita avant d’expliquer au vieux chêne la situation. Ce dernier lui offrit de le soulever pour qu’il puisse lui-même localiser le camp des humains. Il rabaissa une de ses branches et Félix monta dessus. Un instant plus tard, il le souleva très haut. Clément et Zoé virent le petit rongeur tourner la tête avant que le chêne ne le redescendit . -Ils sont par-là ! Dit-Félix aux deux enfants. Et pas très loin, heureusement. Après avoir remercié le chêne, les trois voyageurs reprirent leur chemin. -Pourquoi n’as-tu pas grimpé sur le chêne au lieu de le laisser te soulever ? Clément, qui était quasiment incapable de rester cinq minutes sans parler, demanda. -Et bien parce que ça aurai était offensant pour Aristide ! Cria Félix. Non, mais... grimper le vieux chêne... quel scandale... continua-t-il. -Je vous prie de le pardonner. Il n’est pas très, euhm, instruit sur votre culture. Dit-Zoé qui n’en savait pas plus elle-même mais avait la chance de savoir tenir sa langue contrairement à son petit frère. -Peu importe , peu importe... répondit Félix. Après une bonne demie-heure de marche, Félix déclara qu’ils étaient arrivés. -Vous n’avez qu’à marcher tout droit avant de tourner à droite lorsque vous arrivez au grand sapin et vous verrez votre troupeau. Mais avant, promettez-moi de ne jamais rien dire, pas un seul mot, de ce que vous avez vu. Si vous n’étiez pas mes protégés aujourd’hui, le lion de compagne aura fait de vous son repas du soir. Zoé et Clément lui donnèrent leurs paroles et le remercièrent sincèrement avant de partir. Une fois arrivés au camp, mademoiselle Ludivine les accueilli avec soulagement . Elle leur dit qu’elle les cherchait pendant des heures, et que les Rangers les cherchaient en ce moment même. -Mais comment avez-vous retrouvé votre chemin. -Euh, on a juste marchés et on s’est retrouvé par chance ici. Zoé dit en clignant de l’œil à son frère.

-Tu vas bouder toute la journée ? Maxime dit à son frère. -Ce n’est pas comme si j’ai quelque chose de mieux à faire. Lui répondit Bruno. Les jeunes jumeaux étaient dans leur chambre. Ils avaient été punis car ils avaient négligé leurs études et eu de mauvaises notes dans leurs examens. Leur mère les obligea à réviser tout le matin et les envoya dans leur chambre après le déjeuner. Mais, le pire dans tout ça est qu’elle avait aussi confisqué leurs consoles de jeux vidéo, leurs ordinateurs portables et leurs téléphones. Maintenant, ils étaient coincés dans une pièce sans aucun moyen de divertissement . -On pourrait jouer aux cartes, si tu veux... -Non, Max c’est ennuyeux . -Un, deux, trois, soleil alors ? -Non, la chambre n’est pas assez grande. -On peut lire un livre... Maxime dit, avec de moins en moins enthousiasme à chaque suggestion. Sa dernière proposition semblait avoir capturé l’attention de son frère qui le regardait avec un air moins déprimé . -Quel livre ? Demanda-Bruno. -Celui avec l’histoire des pirates ? -Humm…. Ok, pourquoi pas. Lorsque les deux copies du livre fut tirés des étagères à livre situés au-dessus de leurs bureaux, les deux garçons commencèrent à lire l’histoire à haute voix. Ils lisaient chacun les lignes de dialogue dites par un personnage. En ce moment, Maxime était La Mouette : un moussaillon étourdi qui causait plein de problème sur le bateau et Bruno était Capitaine Barbedure qui passa son temps à le réprimander. - Mille sabords  ! Espèce de marin d’eau douce ! Mais que fais-tu encore ! S’écria-Bruno, ou plutôt Capitaine Barbedure. -C-C-Capitaine ! Je nettoyais le plancher , Monsieur ! -Tu veux dire tu noyais le plancher, oui ! Il y a plus d’eau ici que par- dessus bord ! -Je-je-je m’excuse Capitaine ! Je vais sécher tout ça en un rien de temps  ! Capitaine Barbedure grogna et tenta d’aller parler au timonier . Mais, lorsqu’il prit un pas, La Mouette le heurta et il perdit son équilibre . Sa jambe en bois se coinça dans le seau que La Mouette utilisait pour nettoyer et il tomba sur son dos. -Mille million de mille sabords ! Barbedure exclama. Maxime essaya d’étouffer un rire lorsqu’il entendit Bruno dire cela, et quand celui-ci lui jeta un regard fâché, il s’éclaircit la gorge et reprit sa lecture. -Capitaine ! S’écria La Mouette, inquiet pour Barbedure et pour son propre sort . -Tenez ! Prenez ma main, je vais vous aider ! -Hors de ma vue, abruti  ! Tu as fait assez de mal comme ça ! Décampe avant que je t’envoie nourrir les poissons  ! Barbedure lutta contre son propre poids avant de se relever. Il se dirigea vers sa cabine pour changer ses vêtements qui étaient devenus quasiment trempés après sa chute. Les deux enfants tournèrent la page pour passer au chapitre suivant, et lorsque Bruno vit que c’était une partie plus amusante il dit à son frère qu’ils allaient désormais jouer les rôles des personnages et non seulement leur prêter leurs voix. -Viens, on va préparer la scène . Bruno lui dit. Ils tirèrent leurs chaises de bureau et les mirent côte à côte en longueur devant le lit de Bruno. Celui-ci sortit une règle de 30 centimètres de son cartable tandis que Maxime alla chercher la ceinture de son peignoir . Les deux garçons sortirent également leurs équerres du tiroir et se positionnèrent debout sur leurs lits. Ceux-ci étaient sensés être leurs bateaux alors que le sol était supposé représenter la mer . Bruno jouait le rôle de Barbedure comme avant mais Maxime était désormais Gustave: un Capitaine de la marine royale qui s’était attaqué au bateau pirate de Barbedure. -Chargez les canons, moussaillons ! Hurla Barbedure en pointant son équerre -euh, pistolet sur Gustave. Il tira mais ne toucha pas sa cible qui s’était sauvée à temps. Après quelques dizaines de balles échangées entre les deux ennemies, Babedure ordonna à son équipage de mettre feu aux canons et ils coulèrent le bateau des adversaires. Mais, Capitaine Gustave avait réussi à se servir d’une corde pour sauter de son bateau et atterrir sur le bateau pirate. Il tenta de tirer sur Barbedure mais fut capturé avant qu’il ne put appuyer sur la gâchette . -Alors, on veut se la jouer un héros, Moussaillon ? Barbedure dit à Gustave qui était maintenant ligoté . -Je combattrai jusqu’à mon dernier souffle  ! Lui répondit le marin. -Votre dernier souffle arrivera plus tôt que vous ne pensez ! Dit le pirate, provoquant son équipage à rire grossièrement . Barbedure ordonna à son équipage de jeter l’ancre et de lui ramener son sabre. Ils leur dit ensuite de soulever Capitaine Gustave et le mettre sur la planche en bois qui dépassait le bord du bateau. -J’espère bien que vous êtes prêt pour votre premier -et dernier, j’ose dire - supplice de la planche  ! Dit le pirate qui se tenait debout dernière son prisonnier en pointant son sabre sur son dos. - Un dernier mot ? -Mécréant ! Vous serez capturé tôt ou tard ! -Maintenant c’est vous qui êtes capturé. Et c’est le moment pour une baignade avec les requins . Allez ! Sautez  ! -Mais qu’est ce qui ce passe ici ? Maman dit en ouvrant la porte. Elle entra dans la chambre et trouva Bruno qui utilisait sa règle pour pousser Maxime sur le dos. Bruno était debout sur son lit et Maxime, les mains ligoté avec sa ceinture de peignoir, était sur les deux chaises de bureau qui représentait la planche du bateau. -Euh. Rien, Maman ! Bruno dit avec un air innocent. -On... euh, on jouait aux pirates. Maxime, ne trouvant pas de justification crédible pour ce qui se passait, lui expliqua. -Je vois... et bien, vous pouvez continuer à jouer si vous voulez, mais, je suis venu vous cherchez pour prendre votre goûter. Bruno posa sa règle sur son lit avant de rendre à Maxime sa liberté . -Allez ! Viens, Marin d’eau douce ! C’est l’heur de la chasse au trésor  ! Dit Bruno et ensemble, ils descendirent s’approprier le butin  : des cookies et du lait !

1) Pourquoi Maxime et Bruno ont était punis ?
A. Parce qu’ils étaient malpolis avec le voisin
B. Parce qu’ils avaient négligé leurs études
C. Parce qu’ils s’étaient battus
D. Parce qu’ils avaient cassé la vitre
2) Les deux frères lisait...

Magali sourit avec satisfaction lorsqu’elle regarda les deux pages pleines de son cahier. Finir ses devoirs inspirait toujours un sentiment de productivité chez Elle. Elle commença à ranger ses affaires et son bureau lorsqu’elle entendit frapper à sa porte . Elle vit qu’il s’agissait de sa mère lorsque cette dernière entra après avoir reçu sa permission. -Salut, ma chérie . Que fais-tu ? Dit Maman avec un tendre sourire . -Salut ! Répondit la fillette avant de hausser ses épaules. Rien du tout. Je viens juste de finir mes devoirs et maintenant je n’ai plus rien à faire. -C’est très bien, ma puce. Maman la louangea . Et ça tombe bien que tu n’aies plus rien à faire parce que j’ai quelque chose pour toi. Magali s’assied sur sa chaise de bureau et attendit que Maman lui dise ce qu’elle lui avait apporté . Celle-ci sortit un livre qu’elle cachait derrière son do et le lui donna. -C’est une livre de coloriage et un conte de fée en même temps. Dit-Maman avant de s’installer à coté de Magali lorsqu’elle ouvrit le livre. -Tu vois, là. Elle lui montra une image du doigt . -C’est l’illustration de référence. Tu dois colorier le dessin avec les mêmes couleurs que celles qui y sont. Et dans cette partie, dit-elle en lui montrant l’autre page. Se trouve l’histoire . Après avoir fini son explication et après que sa fille l’eut remercié, Maman quitta la chambre. Magali lut l’histoire et conclut que c’était un conte de fée typique : Une princesse n’avait personne sauf son chien pour lui tenir compagnie et s’ennuyait dans son palais . Sa marraine La bonne fée lui jeta un sort et transforma ses vêtements de sorte qu’elle soit habillée comme une villageoise. Ceci lui permit de s’aventurer dans le village de son royaume et de rencontrer, au centre du village, un prince qui, lui aussi, se déguisait pour explorer les royaumes voisins . Elle pensa que c’était une sorte de Cendrillon à l’envers et ne fut pas vraiment impressionnée et donc, elle passa au coloriage. Mais, après deux dessins, elle trouva que les illustrations n’avait rien de très intéressant non plus et décida donc de prendre les choses en main . Elle allait changer l’histoire et adapter les dessins à sa version du récit . Elle retourna aux pages précédentes et commença à rêvasser . Elle changea les couleurs de la robe de la princesse de rose en noir avec des traits verts. Dans sa tête , la princesse était l’ambassadrice d’une autre planète. Elle dessina un trait rouge qui s’étendit de la baguette magique de la marraine à la robe : c’était un rayon laser. La marraine était vilaine et elle vola les vêtements de l’ambassadrice pour l’empêcher de retourner à sa planète, car ses vêtements lui permettaient de se téléporter d’un endroit à l’autre. Magali bascula vers son monde magique et était désormais devenue l’ambassadrice et son nom était...Célestine. Après avoir perdu ses vêtements, Célestine alla retrouver son gardien. Il avait pris l’apparence d’un chien mais c’était en réalité un extra-terrestre à l’apparence humanoïde , comme elle. -Éon ! Cria-t-elle. On doit partir d’ici immédiatement ! Ce palais n’est plus sûr. J’ai découvert que les humains complotent pour envahir notre planète et l’une d’eux m’a pris mon uniforme lorsqu’elle m’a repéré. -Je n’en crois pas les oreilles, Dame Célestine ! Le chien répondit avec horreur. Je vais contacter notre base aérienne pour les prévenir de notre arrivé ! Il se dirigea vers le miroir de la coiffeuse qui se trouvait dans la chambre de l’ambassadrice et toucha la glace . Après quelques gestes, il se trouva en face d’une personne de son espèce et l’informa brièvement de ce qui s’était passé et qu’ils allaient rentrer chez eux plus tôt que prévu puis retourna son attention vers Célestine. -Nous devons nous rendre au village immédiatement, c’est là où j’avais planté la capsule d’urgences. Lui dit-il. -Allons-y ! Les deux se sauvèrent furtivement hors du palais et coururent vers le village. Une fois arrivés, ils ralentirent leurs pas pour ne pas éveiller les soupçons des humains. -La capsule se trouve au font du puit . Éon dit à Célestine. C’est là que où nous devons aller. Ils continuèrent leur route vers le centre du village et une fois arrivés, Éon reprit son apparence d’humain. Lui et la princesse prétendirent qu’ils venaient juste de se rencontrer et furent semblant de se parler pendant qu’il fit sortir la capsule du puit. Ils étaient sauvés ! Ils montèrent à bord et quittèrent la terre pour informer leur peuple des manigances des humains. Magali sortit de son monde imaginaire et prit le soin d’effacer le chien des images où le prince était présent, car, dans sa version, c’était la même personne. Elle tâcha également de modifier sa tenue et de dessiner la capsule spatiale. Elle tourna les pages du livre et admira avec fierté son œuvre . Les dessins étaient désormais plus excitants avec pleins de couleurs vives mais également du noir et du gris sur les vêtements des extra-terrestres et sur la capsule spatiale. Maman retourna la voir avec un plateau contenant son goûter, et elle allait lui demander si le livre l’avait plu lorsqu’elle vit ses coloriages. -Pourquoi ne t’es-tu pas basée sur les images de références, ma chérie ? Lui demanda-t-elle. -Parce que je n’ai pas trop aimé l’histoire. Répondit Magali. Alors je l’ai changé. Maman lui demanda de lui raconter sa version de l’histoire et Magali le fit en utilisant ses dessins pour mieux expliquer. Maman l’applaudit et pensa qu’elle n’avait peut-être pas ramené le bon cadeau à son enfant. Le lendemain, elle lui donna un carnet de feuilles blanches et lui dit : -Comme ça tu vas pouvoir écrire et dessiner tes propres histoires  !

Un beau jour, dans une cabane perchée sur un arbre, un groupe d’enfants étaient rassemblés pour passer la journée ensemble. Ils étaient tous amis depuis un très jeune âge, ils allaient à la même école et passèrent leur temps libre l’un avec l’autre. Ce jour-là, ils étaient chez Hervé. Celui-ci, allongé sur son dos sur le sol , un bras sous la tête, avait l’air pensif, Un moment après, il se redressa pour prendre une position assise et dit à ses amis : -Vous vous rappelez de la fête d’anniversaire d’Aurélie ? -Je ne pense pas qu’on est prêts de l’oublier de sitôt. Répondit Capucine en posant son livre d’histoire avant de se tourner vers lui. -C’était la fête la plus amusante de ma vie ! Remarqua Aude avec un sourire. -Oui ! S’écria Marcel. Il y avait tellement de jeux ! On avait droit à jouer sur le trampoline et on pouvait même aller dans la piscine ! -Et il y avait tant de bonnes choses à manger ! Ajouta-Cyril avec un sourire rêveur. -Tu parles de la pinata ou des coupes de glace ? Lui demanda Aude avec un sourire taquin . -Je pense qu’on est tous d’accord que la Pizza géante était la star du buffet. Dit-Hervé. -Mais j’y pense, comment fait-on une pizza aussi grande ? Les autres enfants prirent un moment pour penser à une réponse à la question de Capucine mais Aude fit la première à répondre et dit que son père lui avait dit que les choses géantes sont faites avec des pièces rassemblées dans une usine . -Je suppose que ce serait logique vu que la pizza avait quatre parties avec des garnitures différentes. Dit-Marcel en hochant la tête -Ma partie préférée était celle avec la garniture poulet champignons , miam ! Vous imaginez si nous essayons de faire une nous-même ? Demanda-Cyril avec enthousiasme. En entendant cela, les quatre autres commencèrent à rêvasser . Ils furent transportés de leur petite cabane en bois à une grande usine sophistiquée avec plein de machines et de matériaux . -On va commencer par diviser les tâches . Dit-Hervé. Capucine et Cyril vont faire la pâte , Aude et Marcel vont préparer la sauce et moi, je vais rapper le fromage . Quand on aura fini, on va laisser lever les quartiers de pâte et entre-temps, on va tout faire cuire les différentes sortes de garniture et après, on va assembler la Pizza, on mettra la sauce, la garniture et le formage et on fera cuire chaque partie dans un des fours , lorsqu’elles sont toutes cuites, on assemble le tout ! Les autres enfants acceptèrent le plan d’Hervé sauf Cyril qui leva la main et dit : -Je voudrai rapper le fromage à ta place et toi tu peux faire le pâté avec Capucine. -Pas question ! Dit-Aude. Tu mangeras la moitié du fromage si on te laisse faire. Hervé, Capucine et Marcel rirent et Cyril bouda en murmurant que ce n’était pas juste . Les cinq mirent des tabliers , des gants et des coiffes de cuisinier puis se dispersèrent chacun dans son coin . Capucine demanda à Cyril de lui chercher la farine et la levure tant qu’elle fit chauffer un peu d’eau. Elle versa la levure dans l’eau tiède avec un peu de sucre tandis que Cyril lui ramena l’huile et le sel . -Hé, Capucine regarde ! Cyril lui dit avant de lui mettre de la farine sur le nez lorsqu’elle releva la tête pour le regarder en face. -Hé !!! Elle lui rendit le pareil et les deux rigolèrent avant de se remettre au travail. Ils mirent les ingrédients dans le pétrin , puis mirent le bol près du four qu’ils avaient allumé pour le faire préchauffer. Pendant ce temps, Aude et Marcel préparaient la sauce. -Pourquoi on doit y mettre du sucre ? Marcel demanda. -Pour neutraliser l’acidité de la tomate. La fillette lui répondit. -Est-ce qu’on a vraiment besoin de toutes ces épices  ? -Oui, c’est ce qui donne un bon goût à la sauce. -On peut se passer de l’ail par contre, tu ne crois pas ? Marcel dit avec un air incertain. Aude le regarda puis regarda la grande marmite qui contenait les ingrédients de la sauce. -Tu n’aime pas l’ail ? -Non, je trouve ça un peu fort. Ils échangèrent un regard complice et Aude haussa ses épaules avant de poser l’ail sur la table. -Ça ne fera de mal à personne s’il manque un ingrédient, hein ? Lui dit-elle avec un sourire. -Personne n’a besoin de savoir qu’il manque un ingrédient d’ailleurs. Marcel répondit. Ils se serrèrent la main puis continuèrent leur travail : Aude ajoutaient les ingrédients alors que Marcel remuait la sauce sur le feu. De l’autre côté de l’usine, Hervé rappa le fromage et un peu comme Cyril l’aurait fait, il prit le soin de le goûter. -Juste pour voir si c’est de la bonne qualité… Il s’était dit. Lorsque toutes les tâches principales étaient accomplies, le groupe d’enfant passa à la cuisson de garniture. Cyril avait insisté sur une partie poulet champignons, Aude et Capucine voulait des poivrons et des Peppéronis sur une autre, Hervé voulait garnir une partie à l’italienne, de basilic , d’olives et de mozzarella et Marcel surprit tout le monde en choisissant de mettre de l’ananas dans une partie. -À chacun sa tasse  ! Dit-il. Ils firent cuire le tout avant de mettre la sauce la garniture et le fromage sur les quartiers de pâte avant de les transférer au four sur un grand chariot et lorsqu’ils sentirent une délicieuse odeur qui indiqua que leurs parties de pizza étaient prêtes, ils les sortirent prudemment du four, s’aidèrent pour les mettre un à un sur un grand plan de travail puis, les poussèrent cote à cote pour former un grand disque de Pizza. Ils se regardèrent, fatigués , souriant , et surtout fières de leur travail. -Qui a faim  ? Une voix mélodieuse interrompit le rêve éveillé des cinq enfants. Hervé tourna vers sa mère qui se tenait perché sur l’escalier de la cabane. Ça vous dit d’aller manger au resto rapide ? Elle leur demanda. Les cinq amis acceptèrent l’offre avec enthousiasme et lui dirent qu’ils savaient déjà ce qu’ils voulaient : Une Pizza!

Oxy, couché sur son ventre sur le sol avec sa tête, sa queue et ses oreilles baissées , regardait sa maîtresse Alice, qui était en train de faire ses valises , avec tristesse . Elle allait partir en voyage d’affaires et le laisser seul à la maison. -J’ai demandée à la voisine de venir te nourrir pendant mon absence et elle m’a assuré qu’elle prendra soin de toi. Alice lui avait dit quand elle l’informa de ses projets. Elle lui avait assurée qu’elle ne tardera pas, qu’elle allait s’absenter pendant quatre jours seulement, qu’elle aurait préférée l’emmener avec elle mais qu’elle n’avait pas assez de temps pour régler ses papiers et lui promit qu’elle lui apportera des jouets et des gâteries à son retour mais rien de ça ne le rassura, surtout après ce que son ami, le chien errant du quartier lui avait dit. -Ne la crois pas, mes maîtres m’avaient dit la même chose avant de m’abandonner. Rex le cautionna. Et lorsqu’Oxy lui avait demandé ce qu’il lui suggérait de faire, Rex lui dit de se cacher dans les bagages d’Alice. -Comme ça, tu iras avec elle et elle n’aura pas la chance de t’abandonner ! Oxy n’était pas sûr , il pensait qu’Alice serait en colère s’il faisait ça sans sa permission et il ne voulait pas être un vilain chien , mais il ne voulait pas devenir un chien abandonné non-plus ! Il regarda attentivement sa maîtresse ranger ses vêtements dans sa valise et conclut qu’il pouvait s’y installer sans soucis grâce à sa petite taille et lorsque sa maîtresse alla se coucher, il ouvrit la valise et se glissa à l’intérieur pour voir s’il y serait à l’aise, une fois sûr qu’il n’étoufferai pas dedans, il ressortit et alla se coucher. Le matin, il se leva lorsqu’il entendit les mouvements d’Alice qui faisait sa toilette du matin. Elle remplit sa gamelle, l’emmena faire sa promenade puis l’embrassa avant d’aller se préparer pour son voyage. Oxy en profita pour aller se cacher dans la valise de sa maîtresse. Il se glissa entre ses vêtements pour éviter de se faire repérer et resta silencieux. Il entendit Alice tirer la fermeture éclair de sa valise et sentit ses mouvements lorsqu’elle l’avait porté et mise dans la malle du Taxi. Dans l’aéroport, Oxy sentit l’odeur d’un autre chien près de lui et il entendit l’animal lui parler. -Je sais qu’il y a un chien à l’intérieure, je veux juste te prévenir qu’il y a un scanner ici et qu’ils peuvent savoir que tu es là-dedans donc un conseil, si tu ne veux pas te faire repérer, sort de là et je vais te dire comment faire pour monter au bord de l’avion . Oxy eut peur d’avoir des ennuis et sortit le bout de son museau , il leva la tête et vit qu’un chien lui faisait face de l’intérieur d’une caisse de transport . Oxy se présenta et l’autre chien fit de même, l’informant que son nom était Louis. -Voilà ce que tu vas faire… Louis lui expliqua comment esquiver les “gardiens” de l’aéroport pour et lui fit promettre de l’aider à ouvrir la porte de sa caisse de transport une fois à bord de l’avion. -Je vais même partager le contenu de mes gamelles avec toi ! Il lui promit et Oxy le remercia. Une demi-heure plus tard, Oxy sentit Alice soulever sa valise. Peu après, il entendit l’aboiement de Louis qui tentait de distraire les humains et le prit comme son signal pour sortir de la valise avant que celle-ci ne passe par le scanner de l’aéroport. Il se cacha puis se faufila entre les jambes des humains pour retourner à l’intérieur de la valise une fois qu’elle fut scannée. -Oxy ? Il entendit Louis appeler son nom une fois à bord du compartiment de bagage de l’avion et sortit de la valise de sa maîtresse. Il se dirigea vers son nouvel ami et tira sur le fermoir de sa caisse. -Ouf ! Ça commençait à devenir lassant de rester là-dedans ! Dit- Louis avant de lui donner un petit coup de tête affectueux. Content que tu y sois parvenu, mon grand ! Allez, viens ! On va se promener un peu. Les deux chiens marchèrent autour de l’avion, ils observèrent les bagages des passagers et les autres animaux qui étaient à bord, Il y avait un hamster, un serpent , deux chats et deux oiseaux . Certains voulaient sortir de leurs cages pour se dégourdir les pattes et Louis et Oxy les aidèrent à conditions qu’ils retournent dans leurs cages lors de l’atterrissage . -Cet endroit est gigantesque  ! Dit une perruche nommée Arc-en- ciel qui volait autour du compartiment. -Pourquoi n’as-tu pas rejoint ton maître à sa destination en volant ? Lui-demanda Oxy. -Parce qu’il ne me laisse jamais sortir de ma cage, évidement ! -Pourquoi pas ? -Je pense qu’il a peur que je l’abandonne. Les mots d’arc-en-ciel fit penser Oxy à Alice et il se dit que peut-être qu’elle aussi a peur d’être abandonnée. Il se sentit coupable et prit la décision de ne plus se cacher. Une fois que l’avion avait atterrit et que les bagages furent déchargés et envoyés à l’intérieur de l’aéroport, Oxy sortit de la valise et chercha Alice, il sentit son odeur derrière lui et il se retourna et se dirigea vers elle. -Oxy ! Alice s’exclama lorsqu’elle vit son chien courir vers elle. Mais comment es-tu arrivé là ? Oxy lui lécha le menton et elle rigola. Petit coquin  ! Aller, viens, on va voir si l’hôtel va te permettre de rester avec moi.

Sous le soleil brillant de l’été, deux filles jouaient joyeusement ensemble à la marelle . Charlotte et Ines étaient meilleures amies . Elles étaient inséparables et se sentaient chanceuses d’être dans la même classe et d’habiter dans le même quartier . Elles se connaissaient depuis leurs jours passés dans le bac à sable et elles s’imaginaient qu’elles resteraient meilleures amies jusqu’à la mort. Les deux filles s’aimaient beaucoup, et étaient proches comme des sœurs . Ce matin, Ines avait ramené de la craie avec elle et avait proposée à sa copine de jouer au fameux jeu. Charlotte accepta avec enthousiasme et se mit à chercher un caillou pendant qu’Ines traçait le plateau du jeu. Une fois que tout était prêt, leur partie commença. Ines jeta le caillou sur la première case et commença à faire le parcourt à cloche-pied . Lorsqu’elle fit son retour et tenta de jeter le caillou sur la deuxième case, celui-ci atterrit sur la troisième et elle passa son tour . Un petit bout de temps après, lorsqu’Ines prit son tour, Charlotte interrompit son parcourt en lui disant qu’elle avait marché sur le trait . -Mais non, j’étais assez loin des bords de la case. Lui dit Ines. -Mais si, tu n’as peut-être pas pu le voir toi-même mais depuis ma position il était clair que tu avais marché dessus ! Insista-charlotte. -Tu es sûre que tu ne dis pas ça seulement pour avoir ton tour ? Ines plissa ses yeux avec suspicion. -Bien sûr que non, comment peux-tu dire ça ! Charlotte lui répondit en froissant les sourcils . Leur discussion se transforma vite en conflit et les deux filles finirent par se disputer . Par entêtement , aucune d’elles n’avait quitté l’aire de jeux ni continué de jouer. Elles s’assirent, le dos tourné l’une à l’autre et boudèrent en silence jusqu’à ce qu’une vieille dame vînt les saluer. -Bonjour Ines, bonjour Charlotte. Comment allez-vous mes petites ? -Bonjour Madame Morel. Les deux filles répondirent en même temps et lui disent qu’elles vont bien avant de lui demander de ses nouvelles en retour. -Je vais bien, merci. Mme Morel sourit gentiment . J’étais en train de ranger mon grenier et je me demandais si vous voudriez bien me donner un coup de main . Peut-être que vous y trouverez quelque chose que vous aimeriez avoir, même si ça date de plusieurs décennies . Bien qu’elles ne se parlaient pas, et malgré leur mauvaise humeur , les deux filles étaient trop polies et charitables pour refuser d’aider leur vieille voisine et alors, elles acceptèrent de l’aider. -Excellent, je vous remercie ! Je vais passer un coup de fil à vos mères pour les informer que vous êtes chez moi. Mme Morel leur dit et leur promit aussi de leur faire des brownies en guise de récompense . Une fois chez la vieille dame, les deux filles commencèrent à faire un tri des objets qui étaient au grenier. Elles mirent d’un côté ce qui était clairement destiné à être jeté et d’un autre, des choses qui pouvaient encore servir, elles ne savaient pas si Mme Morel voulait les garder , les donner ou les vendre et donc elles préférèrent la laisser décider elle-même. Pendant la demi-heure où elles rangeaient le grenier, elles ne se dirent pas un seul mot jusqu’à ce que Mme Morel vînt vérifier que tout allait bien. -Faites attention ! Aidez-vous pour soulever les objets lourds sinon vous risquez de vous blesser . Leur dit-elle avant de les rejoindre dans le ménage du grenier. Avec leur vieille voisine dans la même pièce, les deux filles n’eurent pas vraiment le choix et commencèrent à se parler, ne serait-ce que pour demander de l’aide occasionnellement. Quelques moments après, Mme Morel les appela pour voir le contenu d’une des boites en carton . -Ce sont vos jouets ? Demanda-Charlotte en saisissant une petite poupée . -Certains, oui. D’autres étaient les jouets de mes enfants. Mme Morel sourit avec nostalgie. Ça, par exemple. Dit-elle en leur montrant un gros ressort coloré et le fit balancer d’une main à l’autre. Ça appartenait à ma fille aînée, Marie. Elle tendit le ressort à Ines et celle-ci le regarda avec fascination avant de le passer à son amie. Et ce jeu de Domino appartenait à mon plus jeune fils. Ajouta- elle en sortant une petite boite en bois . -Et ça ? Charlotte pointa un petit livret du doigt. -Ah ! Mme Morel sourit avec joie et fit sortir le livret de la boite. C’est un album photo qui ne contient que des souvenirs avec ma meilleure amie. Mme Morel ouvrit le petit album et leurs montra des images d’elle et de sa copine d’enfance. Les photos montraient des moments de leur enfance jusqu’à leurs adolescence . -Vous aviez l’air tellement heureuses ! S’exclama Ines qui trouvait les sourires des deux filles dans les photos contagieux. -On l’était. Dit la vieille dame doucement. On était aussi proches que vous l’êtes aujourd’hui. Charlotte qui avait remarqué que sa vieille voisine avait conjugué son verbe au passé lui demanda si elles avaient perdu contacte. -Non, on est restées meilleurs amis jusqu’à la fin. L’an dernier mon amie est décédée . -Oh. Charlotte se sentit coupable d’avoir rappelé quelque chose de triste à Mme Morel et elle baissa les yeux. Je suis désolée. Dit-elle. -Ce n’est pas ta faute ma chérie. Et puis, on a eu tout notre vie pour s’aimer et s’amuser. La vieille dame prit les deux filles dans ses bras. Maintenant c’est à vous de vous faire de bons souvenirs. Ines et Charlotte se regardèrent timidement, un peu embarrassées par leur petite dispute et échangèrent un sourire. Petit à petit, elles recommencèrent à se parler comme les meilleures amie qu’elles étaient. -Regarde ça ! Ines dit à sa copine en lui montrant une paire de raquettes de plage . -Oh ! Tu crois que Mme Morel nous permettra de les garder ? La dame en personne les rejoignit avec un plateau contenu deux grands verres de lait et une assiette remplie de brownies. -Bien sûr que vous pouvez les garder !

Pingouin regardait autour de lui avec crainte et curiosité en même temps. Il se laissa emporter par tout ce qu’il pouvait voir dans la volière , il comprit l’intérêt des perchoirs , mangeoires et points d’eau mais à son avis, les barreaux n’étaient pas nécessaires. Cependant, il se dit que là où il avait l’habitude de traîner, personne ne pouvait voler de toutes façons, avec ou sans barreaux. Ses pensées furent interrompues par la rapide descente d’un oiseau . C’était un faucon à l’apparence majestueuse et aux yeux perçants . L’oiseau se tourna vers lui, le regarda et le salua d’un hochement de tête avant de rediriger son regard droit devant lui tel un bon soldat . Un moment après, une chouette les rejoignit. Elle ne prêta d’attention à aucun d’entre eux et se percha en silence. Pingouin la regarda avant de détourner son regard vers le faucon et ne sut qui l’intimidait le plus entre les deux. Une chose était sûre, les deux étaient très impressionnants, surtout comparé à lui. -Désolé pour le retard, messieurs dames ! Pingouin entendit avant de voir un corbeau atterrir à côté de lui. Ce dernier, contrairement aux autres oiseaux aux yeux menaçants, avait un regard espiègle et un peu moqueur, il sourit à Pingouin et lui fit un clin d’œil . Pingouin ne sut quoi dire et se contenta de sourire au corbeau maladroitement . Certes, il n’était pas aussi intimidant que les deux autres mais il avait du charisme. Après quelques moments passés en silence, un grand aigle descendit sur les quatre animaux et s’installa sur le grand perchoir situé au centre de la volière. L’oiseau qui était déjà immense, devint encore plus formidable sur cette position. Pingouin le regarda avec émerveillement , non seulement parce que c’était le plus grand oiseau présent, mais parce qu’il avait un regard strict et une posture droite et rigide qui commanda l’attention de ceux qui se trouvaient dans la volière. -Bonjour et merci pour votre présence aujourd’hui. Dit-il avec une voix rauque . -Ce n’est pas comme si on avait le choix, on a pratiquement été convoqués , hein ? Murmura-Corbeau à Pingouin en le poussant du coude avec complicité, mais il se redressa lorsqu’il vit le regard du grand aigle fixé sur lui avec irritation. Les quatre oiseaux savaient bien ce qui arrivait aux animaux convoqués par les autorités, ils devenaient des agents qui protègent le zoo et qui partent en missions secrètes pour libérer des animaux capturés par des humains qui les maltraitaient . -Je suis Maître Aigle, votre commandant. Je vais superviser vos entraînements et vos missions. Chacun d’entre vous a été convoqué car il ou elle a du talent et du potentiel. Même si vous êtes habitué à vivre parmi les votre, vous êtes tous différents l’un de l’autre et pour cela vous allez apprendre à travailler en équipe et à survivre ensemble dans de différents environnements. Pingouin pensa que cela était juste pour les autres oiseaux, même Corbeau avait l’air spéciale à sa propre façon, mais il doutait que lui- même avait du “talent et du potentiel” comme Maître Aigle avait dit. -Peut être que je suis sensé leur ramener de l’eau après leurs entraînements. Pensa-t-il, d’un air distrait. Après que Maître Aigle avait fini de parler, le grillage de la volière se transforma pour prendre une apparence de murs sombre et métallique qui chassèrent la lumière du jour hors de la pièce. Les perchoirs prirent un aspect bleu lumineux et plusieurs écrans s’allumèrent. -Votre première mission aura lieu dans un environnement forestier. Assurez-vous de vous nourrir, vous protéger et de prendre soin l’un de l’autre. Si l’un de vous échoue , toute l’équipe échoue. Leur première mission se passa plutôt bien, et ce fut le cas aussi pour les deux missions suivantes qui prirent place dans un désert et une cité. Faucon et Chouette se servirent de leurs talents de chasseurs et Corbeau de son intelligence et de sa ruse pour se nourrir. Pingouin ne mangeait pas les mêmes choses qu’eux mais il pouvait jeûner grâce à ses réserves de gras et ne leurs causa pas de problèmes sur ce point mais lorsqu’il s’agissait de se protéger, il pouvait seulement monter la garde dans leurs territoires lorsque les autres dormaient. Il n’était pas capable de se battre ni de chasser et même si ses coéquipiers ne lui firent jamais de remarques blessantes, il se sentit inutile . Leur quatrième mission se passa dans l’antarctique, un endroit couvert de neige et de glace . Il n’y avait presque pas de proies à chasser ni d’endroits où s’abriter . Le seul qui pouvait s’intégrer sans soucis était Pingouin avec son ventre blanc. -Je ne vois rien. Dit-Faucon d’un air inquiet. -Rien que du blanc, tu veux dire. Corbeau lui dit avec un petit rire. -Et bien, c’est qu’il n y a pas grand-chose à voir. La plupart des animaux ont une fourrure blanche ce qui ne facilite pas la tâche. Pingouin leur dit. Mais on peut pêcher  ! Il y plein de poissons, et vous pouvez tous en manger, n’est-ce pas ? -Oui mais, on n’est pas tous capable de plonger sous l’eau et la glace ne me permet pas d’attraper des poissons qui sont près de la surface. Faucon lui répondit. -Donc, je vais pêcher pour vous ! Je suis très doué pour ça ! Dit Pingouin, content d’enfin pouvoir se rendre utile à ses coéquipiers. Il plongea sous l’eau et nagea à grande vitesse , il remonta à la surface pour déposer des poissons puis replongea. Après un petit bout de temps, il avait réussi à accumuler un tas de poissons et les partagea avec les trois autres oiseaux. Lorsqu’ils retournèrent à la volière, Pingouin sentit que même lui, qui n’était pas aussi majestueux et fort que les autres, avaient ses points forts. Leur équipe finit sa formation et ils devinrent officiellement des agents de la volière.

1) Où se trouvait Pingouin au début de l’histoire ?
A. Dans une volière

C. Dans une basse cour
D. Dans un écurie

Maman ferma le livre d’histoire, le posa sur la table de chevet d’Angela et s’approcha d’elle pour lui embrasser le front. -Bonne nuit ma chérie. Dit-elle en la couvrant avec sa couette . Angela lui souhaita bonne nuit et la regarda éteindre la lumière avant de sortir en laissant la porte entre-ouverte . Elle leva la tête se mit à admirer les étoiles lumineuses produite par sa lampe qui défilaient lentement sur le plafond de sa chambre. En les regardant, Angela se rappela d'un détail tiré de l'histoire de cette nuit : un vieux nain avait dit au prince qu'un arc-en-ciel était en réalité un pont , un portail en quelques sortes qui conduisait à un univers merveilleux où on peut trouver tout ce que l'on désire. Un monde fantastique de magie, de beauté et d'aventures. Cette partie de l'histoire l’avait intéressée beaucoup plus que le reste et elle se demanda dans quel genre de monde elle pouvait atterrir si elle venait un jour à croiser un arc-en-ciel. Y aurait-il des dragons ? Des fées ? Des sirènes ? Angela rêvassa un peu sur ce sujet avant de s'endormir avec un sourire rêveur. Lorsqu’elle se leva le matin, réveillée par son alarme bruyante , elle se rappela de ce qu’elle avait imaginé avant de s’endormir. Elle aurait tellement aimé aller explorer de nouveaux mondes au lieu d’aller en classe ce matin. Elle fit un vœu de voir un arc-en-ciel et sortit de son lit pour aller se préparer. Une fois prête , elle salua ses parents, prit son petit déjeuner et alla à l’école. Sa journée était très ordinaire et rien de spéciale de ne se passa. Elle suivit ses cours, joua avec ses amis lors de la récréation et prit son déjeuner à la cantine avant de reprendre ses cours. Lorsqu’il était temps d’aller à la maison, il commença à pleuvoir et elle due attendre avant d’aller chez elle vu qu’elle n’avait pas ramener de parapluie , elle était surprise car c’était une journée ensoleillée et même Maman ne lui avait pas dit que la météo prévoyait de la pluie ce jour-là. Lorsqu’il cessa enfin de pleuvoir, elle se dirigea chez elle. En route, lorsqu’elle essayait de marcher là où il n’y avait pas de flaques d’eau , elle vit le reflet de quelque chose de coloré dans l’une d’elles et leva la tête pour voir un arc-en-ciel. Ses yeux devinrent larges d’émerveillement et elle se rappela de ce qu’elle avait imaginé hier soir. Angela regarda autour d’elle, il n’y avait personne avec qui partager la joie de ce qu’elle venait de voir. Elle soupira et se dit qu’il aurait été génial si elle pouvait croiser l’arc-en-ciel et se trouver dans un autre monde. Distraitement, elle croisa la flaque d’eau et se sentit poussée par un vent violent qui la fit tomber par terre. -Ouille ! S’exclama-t-elle. Elle ouvrit les yeux mais resta allongée sur le sol qui ne lui parut pas aussi dur qu’elle aurait penser d’un trottoir . La première chose qu’elle vit était un ciel dégagé de couleur bleu qui passait graduellement à un rose pastel, elle fronça les sourcils, confuse, pas deux minutes avant le ciel avait une couleur différente ! Il n’y avait certainement pas de nuages comme avant mais il y avait trois grands cercles blancs clair, presque transparents. Elle entendit le bruissement des feuilles, le chant des oiseaux et même un ruissellement d’eau. Elle sentit fortement la douce odeur des fleurs et de l’herbe qu’elle ne voyait pas encore et fut encore plus désorienté car elle était sûre qu’il n’y avait pas de jardin sur son chemin . Angela se releva et la surprise de ce qu’elle vit la fit exclamer en haletant . Elle était dans une grande plaine couverte d’une multitude de fleurs et de quelques arbres. Elle sentit que ses sens étaient plus aiguisés , son odorat , sa vision et son Ouïe étaient plus sensible et elle remarqua que ce fut le cas aussi pour son touché lorsqu’elle passa sa main sur le tronc d’un arbre. Elle vit une petite rivière qui traversait la plaine et s’approcha d’elle pour voir si l’eau allait avoir un goût aussi différent que les autres sensations qu’elle ventait de vivre. Elle se pencha et ses yeux s’élargirent par l’image qui lui fit face. Ses cheveux avaient des reflets de couleurs d’arc-en-ciel et la couleur verte de ses yeux était devenue plus éclatante . Ses vêtements avaient également changé d’aspect et elle portait à présent une tunique de couleur bleu foncé et lorsqu’elle baissa les yeux pour voir le reste de sa tenue elle vit qu’elle portait aussi un pantalon blanc avec des bottes marron. Une fois qu’elle se remit de la surprise de son changement d’apparence, elle tendit la main pour prendre un peu d’eau, mais elle n’eut pas l’occasion de le faire car son attention fit capturer par le reflet d’un grand dragon de feu qui passait au-dessus d’elle. Elle se tourna et le vit flotter à travers le ciel avec grâce et sentit la chaleur qu’il dégageait. -Mais où suis-je ?! Marmonna-t-elle, bouche bée . -Et bien à Galazio, évidement ! Une voix féminine lui répondit sur un ton jovial. Angela sursauta et regarda autour d’elle pour voir qui venait de lui parler. -Je suis là, un peu plus bas ! La voix la guida. Lorsqu’elle baissa son regard, elle aperçut une minuscule jeune femme assise sur le pétale d’un coquelicot . Bien qu’elle pouvait clairement la voir, elle se mit à genoux et pencha la tête envers elle avec curiosité. -Ne vient pas plus près, je vais attraper froid à cause de tes expirations . La petite femme dit avec un rire taquin . -Vous… vous êtes une fée ? Dit-Angela en s’éloignant. -C’est exacte. -Vous pouvez voler ? -Évidement ! La petite créature dit en sortant ses ailes fièrement. -Et vous avez une baguette magique ? -Euh, non. -Ah… Je m’appelle Angela. -Contente de faire ta connaissance, je suis Emmeline mais tu peux m’appeler Em, comme tout le monde. Angela exprima sa joie de faire sa connaissance puis lui demande s’il y avait d’autres êtres magiques à Galazio. -Tu as déja vu le dragon, il y en a d’autres comme lui. Dit-Em. Il y a aussi des Elfes, des lutins et des licornes , ainsi que des humains comme toi. -Pas de sirènes ? -Non, malheureusement. Mais tu peux en trouver sur la planète voisine ! Em pointa un des cercles blancs, qu’Angela avait vu auparavant, du doigt. -Ce sont donc des plantes… Murmura-t-elle. -Pas toutes, certaines sont des lunes . -Je vois… Elle ne voyait pas vraiment grand-chose, mais que peut- elle dire dans une situation pareille ? Est-ce que je suis sensée combattre de vilaines créatures  ? Demanda la fillette. Em la regarda avec surprise. -Non, il n’y a pas vraiment de “vilaine créatures” ici, tout le monde vis paisiblement . -Donc… dois-je aller explorer des terres lointaines ? -Je… ne pense pas, non. Il n’y a pas grand-chose à explorer, cette planète est minuscule. -Il doit sûrement y avoir quelque chose que je dois faire ! Une quête ou une aventure excitante ! Dit-Angela. -Et bien… tu peux aller à l’école ! C’est amusant l’école…non ? Angela ne prit même pas la peine de répondre et lâcha un grand soupir . -Quand est ce que je peux retourner chez moi ? -Cela dépend de la manière dont tu es arrivé ici. -J’ai… Angela fit une pause et réalisa qu’elle ignorait comment elle était arrivée dans cet endroit. Elle se rappela seulement de l’arc-en- ciel qu’elle avait vu mais il était trop loin et elle ne l’avait pas croisée. Elle avait seulement croisée la flaque d’eau… qui reflétait l’arc-en- ciel… serait-ce possible ? Elle le dit à Em qui lui dit que cela était sûrement le moyen de transport qui la fit venir ici. -Malheureusement , Dit la fée. Les arcs-en-ciel apparaissent seulement lorsque Glazio, le soleil et la planète prisme s’alignent et cela n’arrive qu’une fois tous les quinze jours. Angela ferma les yeux et baissa la tête avec découragement. Il était vrai qu’elle voulait partir en aventure dans un monde lointain mais, selon Em, il n’y avait rien à faire ici, tout comme sur terre ! -Allez, ne soit pas triste ! Je vais te faire visiter et on va te faire de nouveaux amis pour t’occuper jusqu’à l’arrivé de l’arc-en-ciel ! Em la prit par le petit doigt et la traîna un peu partout à travers Glazio. Elle vit les Dragons qui luisaient de mille feux et les Licornes aux douces crinières colorées, les Elfes, les Naines et les Humains de la planète étaient tous très gentils avec elle et l’invitèrent à l’assemblé du soir pour dîner avec eux. La nourriture était splendide et elle découvrit enfin qu’en effet, le goût des choses était plus prononcé aussi dans ce monde. Après le repas du soir, elle dansa un peu avec les enfants de Glazio et lorsqu’il était temps pour eux de rentrer chez eux, elle sentit une tristesse l’envelopper lorsqu’elle les vit partir avec leurs parents : son papa et sa maman lui manquaient. -Allez, viens ! Madame Maeva t’a préparé ta chambre. Lui dit-Em. Au lit  ! Lorsqu’elle fut dans son lit, elle regarda le plafond qui ne portait pas d’étoiles brillantes comme celui de sa chambre sur terre et souhaita de se retrouvée chez elle lorsqu’elle se réveillera le matin. Le lendemain, elle laissa échapper un soupir lorsqu’elle vit qu’elle se trouvait toujours dans Glazio. Elle quitta son lit et sortit de la maison de Mme Maeva après avoir fait sa toilette et prit son petit déjeuner. Elle trouva Em dans le jardin entrain de l’attendre et se dirigea vers elle. -Attention ! Cria la jeune fée. Prise par surprise, Angela s’arrêta brusquement et sentit la chaleur avant de voir la forme d’un Dragon de feu qui passa rapidement devant elle. Elle perdit son équilibre et tomba sur l’herbe du jardin. -Grr, Elle grogna. Mais regarde devant toi ! Cria-t-elle. -Oui, Angela. Est-ce que tu as quelque chose à dire. Elle entendit la voix de Mme Rolland lui dire… Une petite minute ! Mme Rolland ?!! Elle ouvrit les yeux rapidement et vit qu’elle se trouvait dans sa classe et ses camarades et son institutrice la regardaient avec amusement. -Je suis de retour… Chuchota-t-elle avant de détourner son regard vers ses vêtements et elle remarqua qu’elle portait son uniforme d’école. Lorsque la cloche sonna , elle courra chez elle et embrassa ses parents. Il est vrai qu’il n’y avait pas de Dragons ni de Fées, mais elle était chez elle, parmi sa famille, et c’était tout ce qui comptait !

C’était une histoire qui parlait des aventures d’un astronaute, et bien qu’ils ne prêtèrent pas beaucoup d’attention à ce qu’elle disait, leur attention fut capturée lorsqu’ils entendirent les mots : voie lactée . -La voie lactée ? Dit-Monocle, une adorable chatonne avec un œil encerclé de gris . Est-ce qu’elle veut dire un chemin couvert complètement de lait ? Oto, le plus jeune d’eux se redressa en imaginant ce qu’elle venait de dire et Farfouille, leur grand frère la fixa des yeux. -Tu imagine si cet endroit existait vraiment ? Les trois chatons furent transportés dans un univers fictif , où, dans un vaisseau spatial sombre et étroit, le commandant Farfouille, l'officier scientifique Oto et la mécanicienne navigante Monocle étaient assis l’un à côté de l’autre. Ils naviguèrent la navette à travers le cosmos, sérieusement et en silence. Leur mission était de trouvé la voie lactée légendaire et d’en ramener des échantillons et ils ne comptaient pas y échouer . Ils s’arrêtèrent près d’une station spatiale pour s’informer sur le chemin à prendre pour y arriver et ils téléchargèrent un guide spatiale qu’ils chargèrent par la suite dans le système de leur vaisseau. Ils s’assurèrent qu’ils avaient assez de carburant et de provisions pour leur voyage puis reprirent leur vol . Farfouilla pilota l’engin tandis qu’Oto faisaient des recherches sur leur destination et Monocle gardait un œil sur la condition de la navette. Au bout d’un moment, elle remarqua un point clignoter sur le radar et en fit la remarque à ses coéquipiers . -Doit-on les attaquer, commandant ? Demanda-elle en se tournant vers Farfouille. -Hmm... Il est vrai que ce sont nos ennemies jurés mais je pense qu'ils se dirigent vers une destination différente que la nôtre. Nous ferons mieux de nous occuper de nos soucis et de les ignorer. Répondît le commandant sans quitter l’écran du radar des yeux. -Vous ne pensez pas qu'ils veulent goûter aux délices de la voie lactée aussi ? Demanda Oto en remuant sa queue . -Non, je pense plutôt qu'ils ciblent le fromage de la Lune . Ils sont connus pour leurs préférences excentriques. -N'oubliez pas que ces rats s'en prennent à tout, commandant. Je ne serais pas surprise s’ils viennent nous rejoindre après avoir fait leur plein sur la lune. Dit Monocle. -Si cela venait à se passer, on fera d'eux notre repas du soir , je vous donne ma parole de chat. Oto et Monocle hochèrent leurs têtes et se concentrèrent sur leurs tâches tandis que le commandant continua à diriger le vaisseau vers la fameuse rivière de lait flottante au bon milieu de l'espace. Les trois chatons étaient de fameux aventuriers dans l’espace. Farfouille, étant de nature curieuse et intrépide aimait explorer l’univers. Oto aimer apprendre et faire des expériences, et Monocle trouvait leurs aventures amusantes et elle saisit toutes les occasions pour bricoler à bord de la navette. Une fois arrivés à leur destination, les trois chatons mirent leurs combinaisons d’espace et descendirent du vaisseau. Ils flottèrent jusqu’à ce qu’ils arrivèrent au bord de la rivière de lait miraculeuse. La voie lactée était majestueuse, le lait qui y coulait était d’un blanc éclatant et dégageait une lueur subtile qui illuminait l’espace à proximité. -Chat-pristi ! Murmura-Oto avec émerveillement. -Je n’en crois pas mes yeux, c’est incroyable ! Monocle dit, tout à fait d’accord avec son frère. -Si seulement on pouvait enlever nos casques  ! Miaula-Farfouille avec regret. On aurait pu goûter au lait immédiatement, directement de la source ! Oto tendit la patte pour toucher au lait et constata qu’il était agréablement chaud . -On dit que ce lait est infusé avec de la poussière d’étoile ! -C’est donc pour ça qu’il brille autant ! -Oui et je soupçonne que c’est aussi ce qui le garde à la bonne température. -Trêve de bavardage ! Les interrompit-Farfouille impatiemment. Sortez les aspirateurs et commençons à remplir les réservoirs . Oto et Monocle trempèrent de longs tubes-aspirateurs dans la rivière et commencèrent à pomper du lait de la voie lactée dans les réservoirs de leur navette spatiale tandis que Farfouille surveillait les niveaux des réservoirs. Soudain, Monocle leurs dit qu’il y avait un drôle de signal sur son radar portable. -On dirait qu’un vaisseau s’approche à toute vitesse vers nous ! -Restez-ici, je vais vérifier sur le radar de bord. Ordonna-Farfouille. Je suis sûr que ce n’est rien. Quelques instants plus tard, Oto et Monocle furent ordonnés de retourner à bord du vaisseau. -C’est la navette des rats, ils viennent nous attaquer ! Lorsque les rongeures approchèrent, Farfouille les visa et commença à tirer sur eux avec les armes laser de sa navette. -Monocle, tâche à esquiver leurs attaques pendant que nous tirons sur eux, Oto et Moi. Dit-Farfouille avec urgence. Comment osent ces vermines les attaquer ? Près de la voie lactée en plus ! Il n’était pas question de les laisser près de la rivière sacrée ! Ils peuvent la contaminer, après tout ! Après une longue bataille pendant laquelle les deux navettes échangèrent des coups de feu, les rats battirent en retraite et la voie lactée fut à présent sauvée par les courageux chatons de l’espace. -Mais qu’est-ce qu’ils font ? Les chatons entendirent une voix dire. Lorsqu’ils relevèrent leurs têtes, ils virent leurs propriétaires les regarder avec confusion. Monocle sortit de la boite en carton dans laquelle ils jouaient et marcha vers la jeune humaine qui prenait soin d’elle. Farfouille et Oto firent de même et le groupe de chat commença à ronronner sous l’effet des caresses de leurs humains. -Allez, rentrons ! Je suis sûre qu’ils ont faim , donnons-leur un peu de lait. L’humaine de Monocle dit à ses frères.

(French Language) (Reading Comprehension) D G (With Answer)

Théo regardait l’écran de la télévision avec attention en buvant le chocolat chaud que Maman lui avait apportée. Il regardait un dessin animé sur des enfants qui avaient pris une potion magique et étaient devenus minuscules pour explorer le corps de leur ami malade et découvrir ce qui l’avait mis dans cet état . À la fin du dessin animé, les enfants avaient neutralisé le virus qui avait causé la grippe de leur copain et celui-ci avait fini par guérir . Le concept avait fasciné Théo et il se dit qu’il aurait aimé que ce genre d’excursion puisse être réel. Ses pensées furent interrompus par sa petite sœur qui laissa échapper un soupire triste en posant la poupée avec laquelle elle jouait . Théo la regarda et se demanda si, comme les enfants du dessin animé avaient exploré un corps humain, il serait possible d’explorer l’esprit d’une personne. Dans le dessin animé, le corps du petit garçon était formé de vaisseaux sanguins et d’organes, Théo imagina que ce serait pareil pour tous les corps. Tout le monde a des mains , des jambes , une tête et un cœur après tout mais est-ce que c’était pareil pour les esprits ? Est-ce que tout le monde pense aux mêmes choses ? Certainement pas ! Théo le savait bien. Son amie Béatrice n’aimait pas les mêmes choses que lui et ils ont souvent des idées différentes. Il avait aussi remarqué que ses camarades de classes avait de différents intérêts , c’était clair lorsque l’institutrice leurs demandait de lire leurs expressions écrites . Théo se laissa emporter par son imagination et essaya de deviner à quoi ressemblerait l’esprit de sa petite sœur. Il se trouva dans un bac à sable géant plein de jouets. Le ciel était rose pale, Il y avait une douce odeur de shampoing à la fraise et il entendit le son de la musique de la berceuse que sa mère chantait souvent à sa sœur. Il marcha un peu à travers le bac à sable et vit une balançoire dans un coin, des peluches dans un autre et un camion de glace entre les deux coins. Lorsqu’il avança davantage , il vit des dessins colorés de leurs famille que sa sœur avait dessiné et quelques vieux objets comme son doudou et une paire de chaussure qu’elle adorait quand elle était plus jeune et en conclut que cette partie du bac à sable représentait ses souvenirs . -Et bien, c’est un endroit drôlement coloré… Se dit-il une fois qu’il avait fait le tour complet. En revenant à la réalité, son attention fut capturée par le bruit de froissement du journal que Papa était en train de lire et il décida d’imaginer à quoi l’esprit de ce dernier ressemblait. Il se trouva dans un endroit fermé aux murs gris. Il y avait un bureau, une chaise et plein de casiers . L’endroit était calme et silencieux et il y avait une forte odeur de café dans l’air. Il se demanda distraitement si Papa serait en colère contre lui s’il fouillait dans les tiroirs puis se rappela que cet endroit est issu de son imagination à lui. Il s’assied sur la chaise et vit qu’il y avait un ordinateur portable fermé, un stylo et des feuilles, un cadre contenant la photo de la famille -le seul élément de couleurs dans la pièce - et une barre de chocolat. Il rigola en voyant le dernier objet et pensa que son père aurait sûrement du chocolat noir dans son bureau au travail. Il se leva pour aller voir ce qu’il y avait dans les tiroirs des casiers et vit qu’il y avait des étiquettes avec les mots : Famille, travail, sport et plein d’autres sujets écrits sur eux. Le casier de la famille contenait des tiroirs pour chaque membre de la famille et quand il ouvrit le sien, il y trouva des photos de lui lorsqu’il n’était qu’un bébé ainsi que des petites anecdotes écrites sur des feuilles triées dans des dossiers. Il y avait également un tiroir qui contenait les souvenirs de Papa et il y trouva ses photos d’enfance et de jeunesse . -Quelle bonne mémoire ! Murmura-t-il. Il savait déjà que son père était très organisé et il se dit que son imagination avait fait un bon travail en composant cet endroit pour refléter l’esprit de son père. Il se mit ensuite à penser à quoi ressemblerai l’esprit de sa jolie Maman et fut transporté dans une grande pièce éclairé par la chaleureuse lumière du soleil. Il y avait une bonne odeur de cookies et de fleurs. Il entendit une très belle musique joué au piano et vit pleins de photos de lui, sa sœur et son père sur les trois murs de couleur vert pale, le quatrième étant formé de vitres qui s’étendirent du sol au plafond et qui lui permettaient de voir un grand jardin plein d’arbres et de fleurs. Il retourna son attention vers la pièce et remarqua pour la première fois un meuble en bois plein de livres : des romans , des recueils de poésie , des livres d’histoire, des revues scientifiques et même des livres pour enfants. -Je sais déjà ce que je vais lui acheter pour son anniversaire . Dit-il en rigolant. Lorsqu’il cessa de rêvasser , Théo pansa qu’il avait formé ces images en se basant sur ce qu’il connaissait déjà de sa famille. Chaque endroit était plein de choses qu’ils aimaient, de couleurs qu’ils portaient et de sons qu’ils aimaient entendre… ou ne pas entendre, dans le cas de Papa. Mais… pensa-t-il. À quoi peut bien ressembler mon esprit à moi ?

1) Que buvait Théo au début de l’histoire ?

Stéphanie fit tambouriner ses doigts sur son bureau, les yeux fixés sur la feuille blanche qui était posé au centre avec un stylo en dessus. -Mais qu’est-ce que je dois choisir ? Se demanda-t-elle en se penchant en arrière sur sa chaise avec un soupir. Elle devait écrire un texte dans lequel elle décrit sa saison préférée et explique pourquoi elle l’aime tellement. C’était un devoir que leur enseignant leur avait demandé de faire et de rendre le lendemain . Pour Stéfy, les expressions écrites étaient faciles et amusantes à faire, d’ailleurs c’était une des rares choses qu’elle aimait avoir comme devoir. Le seul problème était qu’elle ne savait pas quoi choisir, elle aimait toutes les saisons et n’avait pas une qu’elle préférait. N’était-ce pas le but d’avoir quatre saisons en rotation, après tout, d’avoir l’occasion et le plaisir de les vivre toutes ? Elle aimait la progression naturelle des saisons, elle aimait le froid et la pluie de l’hiver , les couleurs du printemps , la joie de l’été et la douceur de l’automne . Après quelques moments de réflexion, elle décida de demander à ses parents qu’elle était leur saison préférée en espérant que ça l’aiderait à décider. Papa avait dit qu’il aimait l’hiver et lorsque Stéfy lui avait demandé pourquoi pas les autres saisons, il avait dit que son allergie au pollen rendait le printemps pénible, qu’il y avait trop de mouches en automne et qu’il faisait trop chaud pendant l’été. Maman avait choisi l’été simplement parce qu’elle pouvait faire la grasse matinée et ne devait pas se lever tôt pour préparer le petit déjeuner et conduire sa fille à l’école. Pas vraiment convaincu par les raisons de ses parents qui semblaient être plus pratique qu’amusants, Stéphanie alla parler avec ses amis. Tous sauf un lui avaient dit qu’ils préféraient l’été parce que c’est la saison des vacances et qu’ils pouvaient jouer à volonté, n’avaient pas de devoirs et en plus ils pouvaient aller à la plage , le dernier lui avait dit qu’il aimait l’automne parce qu’il aimait voir les feuilles des arbres changer de couleur et le vol des oiseaux qui partent en migration vers des régions plus chaudes. Lorsqu’il lui demanda pourquoi elle voulait savoir, elle lui expliqua son problème. -Je vois, alors ton soucis c’est que tu ne peux pas faire un choix, c’est ça ? -Oui. -Alors, pourquoi n’écris-tu pas un texte qui contient toutes les saisons ? Une saison quatre-en-un en quelques sortes. Suggéra-t- il. Stéphanie tapota son doigt sur son menton et prit quelques instants pour penser à l’idée de son ami. Ce n’était pas mal comme suggestion et l’enseignant n’avait pas précisé de règles qui pouvaient l’empêcher de le faire. Et puis, plus elle y pensait plus elle avait envie de le faire, elle trouvait ça amusant d’imaginer une saison qui regroupe les quatre qui existent. Elle remercia son ami puis rentra chez elle pour commencer son travail. Elle s’assied sur sa chaise de bureau, ferma ses yeux et commença à imaginer son monde ou les saisons étaient fusionnées en une seule. Elle imagina une belle forêt ou les arbres avaient un feuillage tantôt vert de printemps, tantôt doré d’automne, certains arbres étaient recouverts de neige et d’autres portaient des fruits murs . On y entendit le chant des oiseaux et des criquets et on pouvait voir des abeilles et des papillons butiner les fleurs et les baies qui étaient sur les buissons . Il ne faisait pas trop froid, ni trop chaud. Stéphanie ouvrit ses yeux soudainement et secoua sa tête. -Non, ce n’est pas vraiment excitant de mélanger le tout… Murmura-t-elle. Elle prit une pause et alla à la cuisine pour prendre son goûter et son regard fut capturé par l’assiette compartimentée qui contenait des condiments, il y avait de la mayonnaise, du ketchup, de la moutarde et du houmous . En la regardant, Stéfy se demanda à quoi ressemblerait sa forêt imaginaire si elle était divisée comme cette assiette avec les saisons à la place des condiments. Elle s’assied sur l’une des chaises de la cuisine et se plongea dans son monde. Si elle pouvait voir la forêt de haut , elle aurait pu remarquer que celle-ci avait des bordures distinctes cette fois : on pouvait clairement voir ou une partie se termine pour laisser place à une autre. Elle commença à explorer cet endroit et ne tarda pas à constater qu’elle était dans la partie ou le printemps dominait, il y avait plein de couleurs, l’air était frai et les sons des animaux animaient l’endroit. Elle vit un écureuil courir d’un arbre à un autre et le suivit. Lorsqu’elle le vit grimper , son attention fit détournée vers les pommes suspendues sur une branche et elle sentit un changement subtil dans la température de l’air. -Ah, je vois, c’est l’été ici… Dit-elle avant de continuer en avant. Elle leva le bras pour se protéger les yeux des rayons de soleil qui transperçaient les feuilles des arbres, dessinant des motifs mystérieux avec des ombres et des lumières sur le sol. Un vent soudain la fit marcher plus rapidement et elle baissa son bras lorsqu’elle entendit le son des feuilles mortes sur lesquelles elle marchait, les arbres étaient à présent vêtus de feuilles jaunes , oranges, rouges et marrons et elle sentit une odeur agréable de terre humide et de champignons . Elle se pencha au bord d’une rivière et retira sa main aussitôt qu’elle l’étendit pour toucher l’eau. Elle regarda l’autre côté de la rivière et vit que les arbres étaient dévêtus de leurs feuillages et recouvert d’une épaisse couche de neige. Lorsqu’elle ouvrit les yeux, elle sourit et prit une brioche au chocolat avant de retourner dans sa chambre pour transformer ses pensées en mots. Le lendemain, lorsqu’elle lut son expression écrite, toute la classe, y compris son enseignant l’applaudit chaleureusement et tout le monde exprima son envie de visite sa forêt quatre-saisons.

Marianne, assise sur la chaise de bureau de son grand frère , lui racontait avec enthousiasme qu’elle était élue par sa classe pour écrire un poème pour la compétition de son école. Elle lui dit qu’elle voulait écrire quelque chose sur la nature et qu’elle voulait commencer immédiatement. -Et bien, vas-y ! Dit-il après avoir exprimé sa fierté d’elle. Je vais te prêter mon dictionnaire si tu veux ! Il l’encouragea. Marianne rit avec amusement et lui dit qu’elle n’avait pas besoin d’un dictionnaire. -Je n’ai pas été élue pour rien, voyons ! Lui dit-elle. Je connais tous les mots , j’ai même gagné la compétition d’orthographe de mon école ! Grand frère sourit et souleva un sourcil avec étonnement . - Personne ne connaît tous les mots, Anne. Même les grands professeurs de littérature. -Et bien, tant pis pour eux ! Moi je sais que je les connais tous. Je comprends tous les mots dans mon livre de lecture et je n’ai jamais eu besoin d’un dictionnaire ! Répondit la petite fille. -Il est vrai que pour ton âge, tu as plus de connaissances que les autres en littérature mais il y a sûrement quelques mots que tu ignores. -Non, aucun ! Grand frère adorait Marianne et ne voulait pas lui faire de peine , mais il ne voulait pas non plus qu’elle continue à penser qu’elle était arrivé au bout du chemin concernant son éducation. Il était fier du fait qu’elle avait de la confiance en soi mais il savait que ça pouvait très vite se transformer en arrogance et cela l’empêchera d’apprendre davantage de choses au futur, il était sûr qu’elle avait encore beaucoup à apprendre et il voulait l’aidé. Il passa quelques minutes à penser à une bonne méthode pour la corriger sans la vexer et finit par lui suggérer de lui apprendre des choses à lui. -Contrairement à toi, je ne connais malheureusement pas tous les mots… Argumenta-t-il avec tristesse . Marianne qui aimait son grand frère et détestait le voir mécontent , accepta immédiatement de lui apprendre les mots qu’il ne connaissait pas. -Peut être que tu peux me donner des descriptions des choses dont tu ne connais pas le nom et je te dirais comment elles s’appellent. -C’est une très bonne idée ! Dit-il avec joie. Tu sais quoi, il fait beau aujourd’hui. On devrait sortir dans le jardin, comme ça tu vas aussi être inspirée pour ton poème. Marianne accepta d’aller dehors et prit avec elle un petit carnet et un stylo , quant à son grand frère, il n’emporta que son téléphone portable avec lui.

Et ces herbes que Maman utilise dans la cuisine ? Il dit en pointant le doigt vers le petit jardin potager. -Ce sont des aromates  ! -Tu peux me dire ce qu’on appelle une personne qui fait des acrobaties devant les gens dans la rue  ? -Euh, un clown ? Un acrobate ? -Non, non, je crois qu’ils ont une autre appellation. -Je n’en connais pas d’autres. Marianne répondit avec embarras . -Ne t’inquiète pas, on va chercher sur internet. Grand frère écrit quelques mots sur le clavier de son téléphone puis montra à Marianne le contenu de son écran. Ah, regarde là ! Ça s’appelle un saltimbanque. -Oh ! Bon, d’accord alors. Je ne connais pas un mot, ce n’est pas grave ! Vas-y ! Décris-moi autre chose ! Dit-elle. -Comment s’appelle le plat que Maman fait avec des haricots blancs et des saucissons  ? -Le cassoulet ! -Oh ! Et celui avec les choux fermentés ? -La choucroute ! Grand frère l’applaudit avec admiration. -Tu peux me dire ce qu’on appelle l’élevage de lapins domestique ? Marianne pensa un moment avant de dire qu’elle ne croyait pas qu’il y a un mot pour ça, mais grand frère lui dit qu’il valait mieux vérifier quand même. -Ah ! Là ! Cuniculture ! -C’est mignon comme mot. Dit Marianne en rigolant. -Bon, continuons. Dit grand frère. Comment s’appellent ces fleurs ? Il dit on montrant de belles fleurs aux pétales roses. -Des… euh, je ne sais pas. Marianne lui dit. Il en prit une photo et lança une recherche basé sur images. - Regarde, on dit ici que ça s’appelle des Rhododendron. -C’est un peu difficile à prononcer, hein ? Lui demanda-t-elle. -Tout à fait. Reprenant, tu veux bien ? -Non… Tu sais… je ne suis plus aussi sûre que je connais tous les mots, après tout. J’en connais beaucoup, mais il y en a pas mal que je ne connais pas. -Ce n’est pas grave. Dit Grand Frère. Tu peux toujours les apprendre, tu es encore jeune . Peut-être que lorsque tu auras mon âge, tu vas les connaître tous ! -Peut-être même avant ! Marianne dit avec enthousiasme. -Oui ! Pourquoi pas ! Ils gardèrent le silence pour un moment puis Marianne leva sa tête timidement. -Tu veux bien m’apprendre comment chercher des mots sur internet comme tu le fais ? -Bien sûr ! Dit Grand Frère. Et je peux même te montrer comment le faire sur un dictionnaire, tu peux aussi t’en servir pour apprendre plus de mots. -D’accord ! Merci. Grand Frère lui dit qu’ils feraient mieux de rentrer . -Tu as un poème à écrire, après tout !

Jules regardait son père avec de grands yeux pétillants pendant qu’il lui expliquait l’intérêt d’avoir de l’argent de poche avant de lui donner ce qu’il considérait être une petite somme. Mais, pour le petit garçon qui n’avait jamais tenu autant d’argent , c’était une vraie fortune. -Je suis riche… Murmura-t-il. -Et bien… Son père n’avait pas le cœur de le contredire et se suffit de lui sourire. -Je vais pouvoir acheter tant de choses ! Vite, Papa, prends une feuille et fais une liste de tout ce que je te dis ! Jules tira son père par la manche et lui demanda de s’asseoir sur sa chaise de bureau. Papa, céda à sa demande et prit un stylo et une feuille blanche. -Je t’écoute . Lui dit-il. -Euh, d’accord, alors… la première chose que je veux acheter est une petite voiture téléguidée . Papa prit note et retourna son regard vers Jules. -Je vais aussi acheter une machine à glace , un nouveau vélo , des jeux vidéo et un ballon de football . Jules attendit que son père finît de noter tout ça puis énuméra un tas d’autres choses. Au bout d’une demi-heure , Papa avait deux feuilles remplies d’objets que son fils voulait s’acheter avec son argent de poche. Il sourit avec amusement et se demanda comment il allait dire à son petit garçon que l’argent qu’il lui avait donné n’allait pas lui suffire pour s’acheter toutes ces choses. Il regarda Jules courir au meuble à chaussures et mettre ses petites basquettes. -Allez, viens mettre tes chaussures ! Il lui dit avec impatience. Tu dois me conduire au centre commercial pour que je puisse acheter mes affaires. -Pas encore. Dit Papa. Jules fronça les sourcils, mécontent. -Pourquoi pas ? -Viens là, mon chéri. Papa lui demanda en tapotant ses genoux et Jules courra s’y installer. -Je sais que tu es excité et content de recevoir ta première allocation d’argent de poche mais je dois te dire que l’argent que tu as ne va pas te suffire pour acheter tout ce que nous avons noté. En fait, il ne te suffira même pas pour acheter quoi que ce soit dans ta liste prestigieuse. Déçu, Jules baissa la tête et bouda. Comment pouvait-papa lui dire une chose pareil ?! Et pourquoi ne l’avait-il pas dit avant  ? -Regarde-moi. Papa demanda doucement. Tu ne peux pas acheter quelque chose de cher avec, mais tu peux en économiser une partie et au bout de quelques mois tu vas pouvoir t’acheter une des choses dans ta liste. La voiture, par exemple. -Une partie ? Jules le regarda avec confusion. Tu ne crois pas qu’il serait mieux pour moi d’économiser tout mon argent de poche ? Papa hocha la tête. -Tu peux le faire mais… ne voudrais-tu pas en dépenser une partie ? T’acheter des bonbons pour toi et tes amis ? Il est bien d’avoir plein de jouets mais au bout d’un moment tu vas t’en lasser et vouloir sortir jouer avec tes copains dehors. Jules y pensa pour un petit moment, puis dit à son père qu’il ne voulait pas le faire. -Maman dit toujours que les bonbons causent des caries de toute façon. Je ne veux pas que mes dents tombent ni ceux de mes amis. Papa soupira, secoua la tête avec amusement, puis lui dit : - D’accord, c’est comme tu veux. Il lui offrit par la suite une petite tirelire en forme de tortue et lui expliqua qu’elle lui servirait à garder son argent. -Mais sache qu’une fois que tu y mets de l’argent, tu ne peux plus le reprendre parce qu’il n y a pas moyen de l’ouvrir. -Comment je vais faire lorsque j’en ai assez pour acheter ma voiture alors ? -Et bien, tu vas la briser  ! Jules regarda son père avec de grands yeux surpris. -Tu veux que je brise la tortue ? Papa rigola un peu et l’assura que c’est ainsi que la plus part des tirelires marchent. -La prochaine fois je t’offrirais une avec un cadenas , comme ça tu vas pouvoir la garder. Lui promit-il. Après quelques jours, lorsqu’il jouait avec ses deux meilleurs amis, Jules vit un camion de glace se garer près d’eux. Ses deux copains sortirent leur argent et achetèrent des cornets qu’ils partagèrent avec lui. Il se sentit un peu coupable de ne pas avoir voulu garder une partie de son argent pour leur rendre la pareil et le dit à son père. -Et bien, on ne peut pas retirer de l’argent de ta tirelire mais je peux te donner une petite avance sur ton allocation du mois prochain . -Vraiment ? -Oui, mais tu dois d’abord prouver que tu le mérite . Tu dois gagner ton argent. -Qu’est-ce que je dois faire ? Le petit garçon demanda. -Sois un bon petit garçon, aide Maman en rangeant ta chambre et fait tes devoirs. Ne fait pas de bêtises et ne te dispute pas avec tes camardes de garderie et puis c’est tout ! Papa dit avec un sourire encourageant. -D’accord. Dit Jules. Et quand est-ce que je peux avoir l’argent ? -Dans trois jours. -Marché conclu ! Papa rigola et surveilla son fils pendant les jours qui suivirent. Il était content de voir Jules apprendre à être responsable avec son argent et à devenir plus généreux avec. Lorsque trois mois s’écoulèrent, il décida de lui donner une augmentation . -Pourquoi ? Demanda-Jules. -Parce que tu l’as mérité.

Un matin chaud en été vit deux enfants assis devant la télévision, regardant l’écran, épatés par une artiste martial qui démontrait quelques mouvements sophistiqués. -Woah...! Beth exclama et dû se rappeler de ne pas cligner des yeux pour ne rien rater . -C'est tellement cool! Son cousin dit. Il regardait l’émission avec elle dès le début et parut aussi impressionné qu'elle l'était avec les yeux grands ouverts et de petits souffles à chaque fois qu'un mouvement était démontré. -Oui! Agréa Beth avec enthousiasme avant que les deux ne se turent de nouveau pour se concentrer sur l’émission. Les deux restèrent ainsi jusqu'à la fin de l'émission et ne se levèrent que lorsqu'ils furent appelés pour descendre prendre leur déjeuner. -Je veux devenir une artiste martiale quand je serai grande ! La petite fille dit en sautant les marches de l'escalier. -Pas moi! Dit son cousin en courant derrière elle avec maladresse. Ses mots la firent froncer les yeux en confusion. N'était-il pas aussi impressionné qu'elle, tout à l'heure? Comment pouvait-il dire ça? -Pourquoi pas? Demanda-t-elle sur un ton qui reflétait autant de surprise qu'elle avait ressentit. -J'ai entendu dire que les artistes martiaux doivent s’entraîner très dur . J'ai aussi entendu dire qu'ils doivent casser leurs os et se déchirer les muscles pour devenir aussi fort qu'ils le sont. Répondit-il. -Tu n'es pas sérieux ! Exclama-t-elle. C'était horrible! Qui peut bien subir une telle torture? Beth frémit en pensant au fait de subir cette douleur pour devenir un bon artiste martial et elle pensa qu'elle devrait peut être y repenser. Mais, elle continua à penser à l’émission qu'elle avait regardé tout à l'heure et à quel point la dame était cool quand elle donna des coup de points et des coups de pied aux planches en bois. Elle voulait vraiment être comme elle. Peut être qu'elle pourrait prendre des médicaments qui l'aideraient pour supporter la douleur quand elle commencera à s’entraîner? Elle regarda son cousin et plissa les yeux. Peut être que Bobby avait tort à propos de ce qu'il lui avait dit tout à l'heure... Et puis, d'où il savait, lui? Elle devait poser la question à quelqu'un de confiance et elle savait exactement à qui s'adresser! Plus tard dans la journée, quand son cousin fit sa sieste, elle descendit parler à son grand frère qui était chargé de rester avec eux pendant que leurs parents étaient absents pour la journée. -Coucou, Keith! Elle le salua avec bonne humeur. Son grand frère était la personne la plus intelligente qu'elle connaissait. Plus intelligent que ses parents, même! Il répondait toujours à ses questions et même quand il ne connaissait pas la réponse , il la cherchait pour elle. -Coucou, sœurette! Répondit-il avec un sourire en fermant le livre qu'il était entrain de lire. Que puis-je faire pour toi? Dit-il en lui pinçant le nez avec un sourire taquin. Beth rigola et s'assied à coté de lui sur le canapé. -J'ai une question pour toi. Elle commença. Quand son frère hocha la tête elle continua. Est-ce qu'il est vrai que les artistes martiaux doivent se briser les os et se déchirer les muscles quand ils s’entraînent pour devenir plus forts? Les yeux de son grand frère devinrent plus large et il prit un moment avant de lui répondre. -Je suis sûr que ce n'est pas le cas. Qui te l'a dit? -Bobby. -Et bien, comme je te l'ai dit, je ne crois pas que c'est vrai mais regardons sur internet juste pour être certains. Beth regarda Keith sortir son téléphone de sa poche et taper dessus avant de lire ce qui était écrit sur l'écran pendant quelques instants. -Bon, c'est un peu correcte, en quelques sortes. Beth laissa échapper un souffle d'horreur le poussant à lever une main pour la calmer . Mais, ce n'est pas aussi douloureux que ce qu'on croit. Beth parut un peu soulagée par ces mots. -Et bien, c'est comment alors? Demanda-t-elle avec curiosité. Si ce n'était pas de la torture comme elle le croyait, alors elle avait encore une chance pour devenir une artiste martiale au futur. Elle était une fille costaud et elle pourrait supporter un peu de douleur! L'autre jour, elle était tombée et s'était blesser le genou mais elle n'avait même pas pleurer! Keith sourit et lui ébouriffa les cheveux. Il tint son téléphone en face d'elle et pointa l’écran du doigt. -D'après cet article, quand les gens s’entraînent pour un sport qui nécessite de frapper quelque chose ou quelqu'un, ils doivent donner des coups avec leurs mains, pieds, genoux et tout. Il expliqua. Et des fois, ils cassent des planches en bois et des trucs du genre. Pour faire ça, ils doivent frapper à grande vitesse ou bien ils doivent être très forts. Idéalement, l’artiste martial utilise une combinaison de force et de vitesse. Pour devenir aussi forts, ils doivent s’entraîner en soulevant des poids et en faisant des exercices comme des pompes et en frappant des sac de box, et c'est ce qui cause les fissures dans leurs os et leurs muscles. Mais ces fissures ne sont pas dangereuses. L'assura- t-il avec un sourire. Ce sont juste de toutes petites fissures dans leurs os et quand elles guérissent, l'os devient plus dur et plus fort dans ces endroits. Conclut-il. -Ohh...! C'est logique. Beth dit en hochant lentement la tête. -C'est la même chose pour les muscles, et ça n'arrive pas qu'aux artistes martiaux. Des gens comme ceux qui font du bodybuilding soulèvent des poids lourds et ça cause des petites fissures dans leurs muscles à cause de la charge. Quand le muscle guéri et se reconstruit, il devient plus grand et plus fort.C'est pour ça que certains artistes martiaux peuvent briser des briques avec leurs mains, parce qu'ils sont assez forts mais aussi parce qu'ils sont assez rapide quand ils les frappent. -Alors, ça ne fait pas mal du tout? La petite fille demanda. Elle voulait s'assurer avant de prendre sa décision. -Et bien je suis sûr que ce genre d’entraînement peut leur donner des courbatures et leur faire un peu mal mais ce n'est rien de dangereux et s’ils le font correctement, ils ne risquent pas de se blesser. Répondit-il. Le mystère est résolu ! Es-tu satisfaite, jeune demoiselle? Beth sourit et hocha sa tête. -Oui! Maintenant que tout est clair, je veux devenir une artiste martiale! Annonça-t-elle avec fierté. -Oh? Sais-tu quel art martial tu veux pratiquer ? Le Karaté? Le Judo? Le Hapkido? Demanda-t-il. -Euh... je ne sais pas... encore. Keith rigola et lui dit qu'elle pouvait demander à leurs parents quand ils rentrerons. -Peut être qu'ils t'emmèneront à quelques écoles d'arts martiaux et tu peux choisit après avoir observer les autres !

Cindy était assise sur les marches qui étaient à l'entrée de sa maison, elle avait la tête inclinée sur sa main et ses sourcils étaient froncés. Elle scrutait l'herbe du jardin de sa maison comme si celui- ci était la source de tous ses malheurs. Elle était très irritée et ceci était clair à toute personne qui l'aurait vu à ce moment là. Ou plutôt, qui aurait vu ses expressions. La raison pour laquelle Cindy faisait la tête était assez simple: elle était frustrée car elle avait eu une très bonne idée -Ou, du moins, elle avait cru que c'était le cas - qui avait mal tourné quand elle avait essayé de l'exécuter. Son idée n'était pas quelque chose de vraiment compliqué . C’était même une idée très simple. Elle avait pensé que si elle nouait ses lacets et courrait à travers son jardin, elle pourrait s’entraîner seule pour la course à trois jambes de son école . Malheureusement, son idée échoua et quand elle tenta de prendre le premier pas , elle finit par tomber . Ses coudes étaient égratigné et sa fierté était touchée par l'échec de l'idée qu'elle avait cru être brillante. Quelle honte! -Ça aurait été super si les idées pouvaient nous prévenir d'avance et nous dire si elles sont de bonnes ou de mauvaises idées ..." Murmura-t-elle à elle même avec un soupir malheureux. Selon elle, cela l’aurait épargné. Ou du moi, ses coudes auraient été épargnés. Elle commença à rêvasser en pensant à cette idée. -Si ma mauvaise idée était devenue une personne pour me prévenir en avance, elle aurait eu une apparence affreuse... Dit-elle en imaginant une petite version d'elle même habillée en pyjama sales. La "mauvaise" idée avait les cheveux en l'air et du sable dans les yeux, n'ayant clairement pas fait sa toilette du matin. -Je pari que tu ne t'es même pas brossée les dents ... Cindy lui dit. -Pourquoi faire? Je ne vais rien accomplir de toutes façons. La petite idée-Cindy répondit en baillant . -Beurk! J'avais raison, tu as une haleine de chacal! Cindy l'accusa en agitant sa main devant son nez . L'idée sourit et agita la main avec audace avant de disparaître. -Ce n'est pas étonnant qu'elle ait échoué. Pensa-t-elle. J'aurai pu deviner si j'avais vu à quoi elle ressemblait... Avec un soupir, elle décida de se dégourdir les jambes et se leva pour le faire. En descendant les marches, elle pensa à la première personne qui avait pensé à les construire . Elle ne connaissait pas qui avait inventé les marches et donc elle imagina que c'était elle et une petite vision d'elle apparut devant elle. -Salut, petite moi! Salua-t-elle. La petite idée avait une belle apparence. Elle était habillée convenablement mais ses vêtements n'étaient pas très sophistiqués, c'était seulement une salopette en jean avec un T- shirt en coton en dessous. Elle était propre et ses cheveux étaient brossés et tenus en queue de chevale . Elle sourit timidement et fit un signe de la main en guise de salut. -La conception des marches était une idée simple mais très bonne. Cela a permit au gens de monter à de hauts endroits après qu'ils avaient eu des difficultés avec les pentes raides. L'idée l'informa avec un sourire confiant. Cindy hocha la tête. -C'était sûrement une bonne idée vu qu'on l'utilise jusqu'à ce jour. Une autre idée apparut devant elle et s'éclaircit la gorge . - L'ascenseur était une idée encore meilleure. Dit-elle avec une expression hautaine. Celle-ci était habillée en costume parfaitement repassés et portait des lunettes . Ses cheveux était coiffés en un chignon qui rappela à Cindy la directrice de son école. -Très pratique pour les gens avec des handicapes et permet de gagner du temps. D'ailleurs, les gens n'ont qu'a appuyer sur quelques boutons. L'idée ajouta. Avant que Cindy n'eut le temps de répondre, l’idée-escalier prit la parole. -Oui, m-mais inutile sans électricité. Elle argumenta en levant son index. L'idée-ascenseur laissa échapper un souffle et parut très offensée. - De nos jours, les coupures de courant sont très rares. Répondit-elle en croisant les bras. -Pas aussi rares que ça dans certains pays . Je suis sûre qu'ils sont contents d'avoir des escalier. Telle était la réponse de l’idée- escalier. Cindy rigola en regardant les deux idées se chamailler sur laquelle d'entre elles était la plus révolutionnaire jusqu'à ce que les deux disparurent avec un son de "pouf" et en laissant un nuage de poussière colorée derrière elles. Elle continua à marcher sans destination en tête à travers le jardin et s’arrêta quand elle vit un naine de jardin. Cindy inclina la tête sur le coté et le regarda avec confusion. C'était l'une des idées dont elle ne pouvait pas se résigner. À quoi pensait la personne qui les avait inventé? Soudain , une autre idée apparut devant elle. Celle-là portait une jupe , un tricot en laine et une paire de mocassins. Ses cheveux était en cascade et elle regarda autour d'elle, distraite par son entourage. -Salut...? Cindy la salua avec hésitation. -Es-tu censée être une bonne ou mauvaise idée? L'idée haussa ses épaules et sourit. -Je suis l'idée-naine-de-jardin. Je n'était qu'une pensée impulsive, rien de trop sophistiqué. -Et bien, comment celui qui t'a inventé a su que tu allait devenir populaire? Cindy demanda. L'idée sourit et secoua la tête. -Il ne le savait pas. Il m'a juste appliqué en espérant avoir un bon résultat. Certaines choses dans la vie marchent ainsi, le sais-tu? Tu dois tenter ta chance et voir ce qui va se passer! Cindy regarda l'idée en face. Elle n'y avait pas penser ainsi. Elle pensa que cette approche allait lui éviter des déceptions . Si quelqu'un essai quelque chose sans penser à sa réussite ou son échec, il ne serait pas déçu en cas d’échec. D'autre part, si l'idée réussi, il aurait une bonne surprise. -Et bien, je dois y aller! À plus tard! L'idée-nain-de-jardin dit avant de disparaître. Cindy scruta l'endroit où l'idée était avant qu'un sourire n’apparut lentement sur son visage . -Je crois qu'il temps de réfléchir à quelques idées... Se dit-elle en courant à sa chambre pour commencer à planifier sa prochaine idée.

En un jour chaud et ensoleillé , tandis que les criquets chantaient et que les fourmilles montaient en queue sur un arbre , Jacob était à quatre pattes dans le petit jardin de sa maison et cherchait sans relâche dans l'herbe en quête du trèfle à quatre feuilles légendaire. Le but principale de sa recherche était de s'attribuer la chance qui venait de l'objet, comme tout le monde. Il ne croyait pas qu'il allait trouver facilementun fer de cheval dans la villeet il ne voulait certainement pas avoir la patte d'un lapin ! Quel genre de personne sans cœur pourrait faire ça à un pauvre lapinou ?!! Et donc, sa seule option était un trèfle à quatre feuilles . S’il arrivait à l'avoir, il aurait de la chance et s’il allait avoir de la chance tout ira à merveille dans sa vie . Le seul problème était que, malgré sa recherche méticuleuse , il n'arrivait pas à trouver l'objet en question. Il commençait à se sentir frustré après une demi-heure de recherche et il considérait sérieusement d'abandonner sa tâche. -Je commence à croire qu'ils n'ont jamais existé... murmura-t-il de manière grincheuse en se tapotant les mains pour se débarrasser de la terre avec un souffle. -Qu'est-ce qui te fait marmonner comme ça, petit? La voix de sa grande sœur survint de derrière lui, le faisant sursauter . -Leah! Ne viens pas derrière les gens ainsi! La gronda-t-il en fronçant les sourcils. -Pardon . Dit-elle en rigolant avant de s'asseoir sur l'herbe à côté de lui. Alors, pourquoi es-tu si contrarié ? Demanda-t-elle en lui pinçant la joue avant qu'il ne tapa sa main. Il laissa échapper un souffle avec un regard misérable et se massa la tempe pour se calmer. -J'ai cherché partout à travers le jardin pour trouver un trèfle à quatre feuilles mais apparemment, tous les trèfles ici n'ont que trois feuilles. -Je vois. Leah dit en mettant un bras sur ses genoux avant de mettre son menton dessus. -Et pourquoi as-tu besoin d'en trouver un à quatre feuilles ? -Pour avoir de la chance, bien sûr. Pourquoi d'autre? Dit-il en froissant son front . -Et bien, pourquoi as-tu besoin d'avoir de la chance? Est-ce qu'elle jouait l'idiote exprès ? Il savait à quel point elle était intelligente , alors elle était sûrement entrain de le taquiner . Jacob n'était pas d'humeur à se faire taquiner! -Et bien pour tout! La chance nous aide avec tout, n'est-ce pas? Ça rend tout plus facile et meilleur! Je serai meilleur en football et j'aurais de meilleures notes et je gagnerai chaque partie de jeux vidéos que je jouerai! Expliqua-t-il en agitant ses mains un peu partout. Sa grande sœur rigola et lui ébouriffa les cheveux . -Calme-toi , mon grand. Je comprends. -Alors tu vois pourquoi j'ai besoin de le trouver. -Je ne crois pas que la chance marche autant que tu le pense, tu sais? Leah dit. Jacob souffla et roula ses yeux. -Ouai, c'est ça. Elle ne savait rien ... Les adultes ne savaient rien sur ses problèmes. -Non, je suis sérieuse . Est-ce que tu connais quelqu'un qui a réussi dans sa vie en comptant sur la chance? Lui demanda-t-elle en arquant ses sourcils. -Et bien... non, mais... Il prit un moment pour penser à un argument mais ne pouvait pas en avoir un. -Tu vois? La majorité des gens qui ont accompli leurs buts comptent sur autre chose. Peux-tu deviner ce que c'est? Demanda-t-elle avec un sourire taquin. -Les miracles? Jacob répondit avec sarcasme, la faisant rire. -Non, petit malin! Le travail . Les gens travaillent dur pour réaliser leurs rêves . Ils s’améliorent dans leur métiers en travaillant dur et en s'appliquant et ils amassent de l'expérience et du savoir qui les aideraient par la suite à travailler plus rapidement et de façon meilleure. Expliqua-t-elle. -Ah, bon? Donne-moi un exemple. Le petit garçon la défia en croisant les bras. -Toi! Tu te rappelle à quel point tu était faible en Histoire? Jacob fit une grimace en pensant à ses vieilles notes en Histoire. Il détestait la matière et avait refusé de la réviser . Mais, il était arrivé à s'y améliorer et il avait trouvé une manière de mémoriser ses leçons de manière efficace quand il s'était décidé à le faire et avec l'aide de Leah. Maintenant, l'Histoire était devenue l'une de ses matières préférées et il n'avait que de bonnes notes . -D'accord. Quoi d'autre? Demanda-t-il, pas très convaincu. Leah se tourna pour regarder la maison puis autour d'elle pour s'assurer que personne d'autre que Jacob ne pouvait l'entendre. -Tu te souviens à quel point Maman était mauvaise en jardinage ? Jacob rigola en pensant à toutes les pauvres plantes que sa mère avait noyé en les arrosant plus qu'il ne fallait. -Elle a fait beaucoup de progrès... Dit-il en regardant les rosiers qui étaient en pleine floraison grâce aux soins de sa mère. -Et tout le monde sait que j’étais très mauvaise en basketball quand je venait tout juste de commencer . Maintenant, regarde-moi! Après des mois et des mois de travail dur, je suis devenue capitaine de mon équipe à l'école! Leah dit avec un sourire fier . -C'est vrai. Papa n’arrête pas de parler de tes exploits. Jacob dit avec un sourire taquin. -Tu vois? En réalité, tout le monde peut devenir excellent dans n'importe quel domaine. Tu es devenu meilleur en Histoire après avoir fait des efforts. Maman est devenue meilleur en jardinage parce qu'elle a refusé d'abandonner malgré toutes les plantes qu'elle avait tué et moi, je suis devenue meilleur en basketball après des heures et des heures d’entraînement. Toute personne qui est bonne dans un domaine était mauvaise au début et s'est seulement améliorée après s'être exercée et avoir travaillé dur. La chance est une jolie chose mais si tout le monde comptait sur elle, on n'aurait pas de progrès dans tous les domaines. Jacob hocha la tête et sourit . -Je comprends. Et puis qui a besoin de chance? Je peux tout faire tout seul. -Et si tu as des soucis , tu peux toujours demander de l'aide. Leah lui rappela avec un sourire. Jacob sourit et la regarda d'un air penaud . -Alors... tu veux bien m'aider pour trouver le trèfle à quatre feuilles...? Pas pour avoir de la chance! Juste parce que je pense que ce serait cool d'en trouver un! Leah roula les yeux au ciel avec une expression affectueuse et lui sourit avant que les deux ne recommencèrent à chercher le fameux objet porteur de chance.

-C'est trop calme ici. Charlie dit en avançant avec prudence à travers les allées humides de la cité . Il faisait nuit, les lampadaires clignait, tantôt allumés , tantôt éteints et la lune était cachée par les nuages . La rue était sombre et suspicieuse. Il monta les escaliers de secours qui étaient sales et couverts de rouille puis, il se positionna sur le bord de la terrasse pour ensuite pouvoir regarder à travers le télescope de son fusil de tireur d'élites. Il guetta les parages et garda l’œil grand ouvert pour voir si il y avait n'importe quel signe de problèmes. Quelques moments plus tard, les bruits perçants de tirs venant d’une arme à feu raisonnèrent en bas. Il vit son partenaire courir hors d'un immeuble avant de s’abriter derrière un camion et il essaya de localiser l'ennemie. Une fois qu'il repéra le tireur qui avait prit feu sur son partenaire, il le cibla et l'élimina avec une seule balle sur le front. "Mission accomplie. Ton équipe a gagné!" Les parleurs de son casque annoncèrent, le tirant hors du sérieux atmosphère du jeu. -Bien joué, Chuck! La voix de son partenaire et ami dit à travers son casque, le félicitant pour sa manœuvre talentueuse dans le jeu. -Merci. Toi aussi! Tu veux jouer une autre partie? Charlie demanda sur un ton excité. -Je ne peux pas. Ma mère m'appelle pour le déjeuner . Peut être plus tard! -D'accord. À plus tard, alors! Charlie dit avant de se déconnecter. Il ouvrit un autre jeux et était sur le point de lancer une partie quand sa mère l’appela pour descendre prendre son déjeuner. Il soupira, déçu qu'il allait devoir attendre jusqu'à plus tard pour jouer davantage et enleva son casque et le mit sur son bureau avant de mettre son ordinateur en veille. En sortant de sa chambre, il vit sa petite sœur descendre les escaliers pour aller à la cuisine pour le déjeuner et il perdit soudain tout contact avec la réalité et commença à voir son entourage autant qu'un environnement de jeu. Charlie avança à travers le couloir sans faire de bruit, il se cacha derrière des meubles et des chaises avant de descendre silencieusement les escalier . Une fois derrière sa petite sœur, il lui donna un petit coup sur la tête avec son index qui était pointé comme un pistolet. -Pam! Je t'ai eu! Dit-il. -Arrête, tu es méchant! Sa petite sœur lui dit en se tournant pour lui taper la main. -Tu n'est qu'une pleurnicheuse, Trixie! Dit-il. Je vais arriver avant toi au quartier général! Et sur ce, il la poussa à coté et courut à la cuisine. Sa petite sœur roula les yeux au plafond à cause de son comportement et marcha calmement vers la cuisine. -Maman, Charlie est entrain de faire l'idiot encore une fois! Elle se plaignit avant de s'asseoir. -Trix, qu'est-ce qu'on a dit à propos d'insulter ton frère? Sa mère la réprimanda. -Désolée... La petite fille s'excusa avant de tirer la langue à Charlie qui était entrain de lui sourire avec un air taquin. -Merci d'avoir soutenu mon clan, grand maître. Charlie dit à sa mère. Et merci pour ce festin. Sa mère laissa échapper un rire et secoua la tête en le regardant. - Je ne soutiens aucun clan, Charles. Tu ne doit pas embêter ta sœur. Dit-elle sur un ton strict mais pas cruel. Charlie fit une grimace en entendant son prénom. -Je ne l’embêtait pas! Je jouait seulement avec elle! Comme ça, regarde! Il prit une olive du plat de condiments, la mit sur sa cuillère puis plia la cuillère de façon qui lui aurait permit de tirer l'olive sur Trixie lorsqu'il la lâcherait. -Charles, n'ose même pas y penser! Sa mère le prévint. Le garçon soupira et posa la cuillère et l'olive. -Personne n’apprécie mon talent... Sa mère laissa sortir un soupir et décida qu'il était temps d'avoir une discussion sérieuse avec le garçon. -Charlie, mon chou, tu dois cesser d'agir comme si tout est un jeu. Ton enseignant m'a appelé l'autre jour et m'a dit que tu t'es bagarré avec ton camarade et que tu as refusé de t'excuser. -Ça, c'était différent ! -Quand tu lui as demandé pourquoi tu devais t'excuser et qu’il t'a dit que c'était parce que tu l'avait vexé qu'avais-tu répondu? -Je lui ai demandé comment il pouvait le savoir alors qu'il ne pouvait même pas lire ses données... Il murmura en évitant de regarder sa mère dans les yeux. -Oui et je crois que tu sais bien que les gens ne peuvent pas... visualiser les données des autres, n'est-ce pas? -Oui, Maman. -Et tu sais que tu ne dois pas jeter des olives sur ta sœur, pas vrai? -Oui. -Et tu dois arrêter de dite que la maison du voisine est un "Territoire ennemi", c'est offensant. -Mais leur chien ne cesse pas d'aboyer quand Trix et moi allons à l'école le matin! Il répondit à sa défense. -Charlie. Sa mère dit pour le mettre en garde. -D'accordje ne vais plus dire ça... -Mon chéri, je ne veux pas te rendre triste. Mais si tu continues à agir comme ça, tu va avoir des ennuis . Sa mère dit en caressant sa joue affectueusement. Je m'inquiète pour toi, Charlie. Il se sentit coupable d'avoir inquiété sa mère et lui sourit d'un air penaud. -Je suis désolé, maman. Parfois, je me laisse aller mais je te promets que je vais essayer de mieux me comporter dorénavant. -Tant mieux, parce que sinon Maman et Papa vont confisquer tes jeux! Sa petite sœur menaça. -Ils ne peuvent pas confisquer des jeux en ligne, petit génie! -Et bien, alors il vont confisquer ton ordinateur! -Allons, allons les enfants. Du moment que tout le monde se comporte sagement, rien ne va être confisqué et Charlie a promis de rester sage. Leur mère dit. -Par contre, ceux qui ne finiront pas leurs assiettes ne vont pas avoir de dessert. Les deux enfants échangèrent un regard avant de tourner leur attention sur leurs assiettes et il continuèrent de manger avec enthousiasme .

Un après-midi nuageux , alors que la brise soufflait doucement pour apporter un peu de fraîcheur, un vieil homme et sa petite-fille entrèrent dans une boutique de bibelot au bord de la mer. Tandis que le vieil homme alla parler avec le propriétaire de la boutique qui était son ami, la petite fille profita de l'occasion pour regarder autour d'elle et observer ce qu’il y avait dans la boutique comme articles. Elle admira les différents petits bibelots qui paraissaient être des souvenirs ramenés de voyages à travers de différents et lointains mondes . Elle vit quelques carillons éoliens , tous de différentes couleurs et tailles ce qui indiquait qu'ils étaient collectionnés à travers les années plutôt que fournis en gros depuis un stock d'usine . Elle passa les doigts à travers eux et se détendit en entendant le son de leur doux tintement avant de passer à l'objet suivant qui attira son attention, les capteurs de rêves . Les objets circulaires avaient des filets tissés en différents motifs et décorés avec des perles colorées ainsi que de très belles plumes qui étaient suspendues sur la partie inférieur. Chaque capteur de rêves paraissait unique et diffèrent des autres. Après qu'elle les eut admirés assez longtemps , elle se tourna aux jolies poupées russes qui étaient mises en valeur sur une étagère qui leur avait été dédiée. Elle rigola en voyant à quel point les poupées rondes étaient mignonnes et sourit avec affection en admirant leurs couleurs . En dans l'étagère qui était en dessous, il y avait des œufs de joaillier, émaillés d'or et d'argent et incrustés de pierres précieuses qui brillaient dans la faible lueur, ils avaient l'air très chers et elle se demanda ce qu'ils faisaient dans une boutique de bibelot au lieu d'être dans une bijouterie . Cependant, ce qui attira l'attention de la petite fille le plus étaient les bateaux en bouteilles qui étaient dans un coin de la boutique. Ils étaient sur un présentoir de façon à ce que chaque bateau était sur une étagère . Certains étaient plus larges que les autres mais ils inspirèrent tous la même émotion : l'émerveillement . -As-tu trouvé quelque chose qui t'a plu, Aria ? Son grand-père dit de l'autre côté du magasin où le comptoir se situait. -Je suis juste entrain d’observer ! Répondit-elle sans détourner son regard des bateaux en bouteilles. -Mais, comment... ? Murmura-t- elle. Comment étaient-ils faits ? Était ce qu'elle se demandait. Comment est-ce que les gens sont arrivés à faire rentrer des bateaux de cette taille dans des bouteilles à travers leurs petites ouvertures ? Le propriétaire du magasin et son grand-père se rendirent où elle se tenait et tandis que son grand-père serra un bras autour de ses épaules , l'autre homme prit l'une des bouteilles. -Tu te demandes comment ils sont faits, n'est-ce pas ? Il questionna avec un doux regard. -Oui ! Comment avez-vous su ? Le vieil homme rigola et lui tapota la tête tendrement. -Tout le monde se pose cette question quand ils les voient. Dit-il en lui passant la bouteille. Aria tendit ses mains et lui prit le bateau. Elle le tint au niveau de ses yeux et plissa ces derniers pour voir tous les détails du bateau. Il était fait en bois et les voiles semblaient être faits en papier. Tout avait l'air réel, du nom peint sur le côté bateau au nid de pie sur le point le plus haut. -Alors... vous savez comment ça a été fait ? Demanda-t-elle curieusement au propriétaire de la boutique en lui repassant le précieux objet. Le vieil homme hocha la tête et se tourna vers elle après avoir remis la bouteille à sa place. -Certains croient qu'il y a longtemps de cela, quand les marins oublièrent leurs bouteilles ouvertes avant de s'endormir, de toutes petites créatures sortaient de leurs cachettes et construisaient des bateaux qui flottèrent sur le liquide qui était dans la bouteille. Quand le liquide séchait au lever du jour, les créatures disparaissaient après avoir fini leur tâche et seul le bateau restait dans la bouteille, la rendant inutilisable. Les marins n'avaient pas d'autres choix que de garder les bateaux en bouteilles pour décorer ou les vendre aux touristes. Émerveillée par la légende, Aria ne dit rien à travers le récit du vieux vendeur. -Cependant, le vieil homme reprit la parole. -Les humains commencèrent à copier le travail des minuscules êtres et commencèrent à créer ces modèles eux-mêmes. D'ailleurs, Dit-il en regardant son grand père. -Ton vieillard sait comment les fabriquer. Tous ces modèles ont été faits par ton grand-père ! Aria laissa échapper un souffle et tourna la tête pour faire face à son grand-père. -Vraiment ? Murmura-t-elle. Grand-père rigola et la serra contre lui. -En effet. On peut en faire un quand on rentre à la maison si tu veux. Lui dit-il. -Oui, s'il te plaît ! Dit-elle avec grand enthousiasme. Tenant sa parole, lorsqu'ils retournèrent chez lui, grand-père ramena du bois, du papier, de la colle et d'autres matériaux dont ils avaient besoin pour faire le modèle. -Tout d’abord, on va construire la base du bateau. Son grand-père lui dit en prenant un morceau de bois et en commençant à le sculpter avant de le peindre en marron foncé. -Puis, on commence par le glisser à l’intérieur de la bouteille. On va monter les différentes pièces du bateau à l'intérieur de la bouteille. Il fit cela avant de demander à sa petite fille de dessiner des formes de voiles sur le papier. -Maintenant, coupe-les pendant que je noue le fil qui va servir de cordes à la base du bateau. Les deux travaillèrent en silence, chacun plongé dans sa tâche et quand il était temps pour la touche finale, grand-père utilisa deux longs crochets en métal pour tirer les fils qui étaient noués aux voiles et en tirant rapidement sur eux, les voiles s'étendirent et l’œuvre fut terminée. -Juste un dernier petit détail. Dit-il en lui passant le bouchon en liège. -Tu veux bien ? -Avec plaisir ! Aria prit la pièce en bois dans sa main et l’inséra dans l'ouverture de la bouteille en verre. -Voilà. C'est fini !

C'était calme et silencieux chez les Walter, mis à part les sons de claquement de fourchettes contre les plats. Toute la famille était réunie pour savourer leur déjeuner ensemble et bien qu'ils parlèrent à certains moments, ils étaient principalement concentrés sur leurs assiettes . Jayden le membre le plus jeune de la famille prit un morceau de carotte avec sa fourchette et le regarda curieusement. Ça n'avait pas un mauvais goût et il n'avait jamais eu de problèmes pour manger ses légumes mais il ne les trouvait pas aussi bons que du chocolat ou des bonbons . -Est-ce qu'il y a un problème avec ta nourriture , mon grand? Demanda son père qui avait préparer le déjeuner ce jour-là en le voyant regarder le morceau de carotte. -Non. Tout est bon. Jayden dit en mettant le morceau de légume dans sa bouche . -Pourquoi regardais-tu tes carottes comme ça, alors? Demanda sa mère. Le petit garçon haussa ses épaules avec nonchalance. -C'est juste que je ne comprends pas . Sa réponse vague n'éclaircit rien pour ses parents et son père lui demanda ce qu'il ne comprit pas exactement. Jayden finit de mâcher sa nourriture avant de répondre. -Et bien, pourquoi devons-nous manger des légumes et de la viande et des pattes et tout quand on peut manger des trucs bons au lieu de ça? -Tu ne trouves pas que les pattes sont bonnes? J'ai cru que tu aimais les spaghetti aux boulettes de viande . Son père lui dit. Tu avais dit que c'était bon la dernière fois que nous en avons mangé. -Ouai, ce n'est pas mal je crois... Il soupira avant de prendre un peu de brocoli de son assiette et de le manger. Ses parents se regardèrent avant que sa mère ne lui demanda ce qu'il voulait dire par des trucs bons. -Et bien, tu sais... Il posa sa fourchette et regarda ses parents. Des barres de chocolats et des sucettes et des bonbons. Des trucs bons comme ça. Pourquoi ne pouvons-nous pas en manger à chaque repas ? On n’en mange qu'autant que gâteries et dans les fêtes . -Et bien, c'est parce qu'ils ne sont pas très nutritifs . Son père lui dit. Jayden ne savait pas ce que “nutritifs” voulait dire et fixa son père du regard. Celui-ci reçu le message et commença à expliquer en termes plus simples. -Tu n'auras pas de vitamines ni de protéines en mangeant des bonbons. Ce n'est en réalité que du sucre ... et il y a aussi du gras dans du chocolat et quelques autres sortes de bonbons. -Je croyais que le sucre nous donne de l’énergie. Jayden dit en retour. -Et bien, c'est vrai mais seulement en petites quantités . Et il y a aussi quelques types de sucre plus complexes qui nous donnent de l’énergie de façons meilleurs et tu peux en trouver dans les pommes de terre et les pattes. La maman de Jayden lui expliqua en montrant son assiette du doigt. Il regarda la part de purée de pomme de terre qui était dans son assiette et en prit une bouchée avant de retourner son attention vers ses parents. -Haylee prend ces pilules qui contiennent des vitamines à l’intérieur. Dit-il en pointant sa fourchette sur sa grande sœur. Pourquoi on en prend pas à la place des légumes? Comme ça on aura des vitamines et on gardera de la place dans nos ventres pour les bonbons? -Et bien, ces pilules s'appellent des suppléments et ils ne sont utilisés que pour t'aider. Haylee mange quand même tous ses légumes et sa nourriture, n'est-ce pas? Sa mère répondit. -Oui, je suppose... -Et les suppléments ne contiennent pas de fibres. Les fibres sont très importantes parce qu’elles aident ton ventre pour digérer ta nourriture. Si tu ne manges pas assez de fibres, tu peux avoir des maux d'estomac . Son père ajouta. -Et même quand tu manges ta nourriture, tu peux quand même avoir mal au ventre en mangeant trop de bonbons et de sucreries . Tu te rappelles de la fois où tu avais mangé la moitié du gâteau d'anniversaire de Grand-mère? Sa mère demanda en arquant son sourcil. Jayden fit une grimace en se rappelant du souvenir. Non seulement il avait eu terriblement mal au ventre, il avait dû boire un horrible sirop amer pour se remettre de son malaise. Beurk! Oui. Je m'en rappelle. -Et les bonbons te font grossir! Sa grande sœur lui dit. C'était la première fois qu'elle avait parlé depuis le début de la conversation. Jayden fronça ses sourcils et la regarda curieusement. Comment était-il possible pour un tout petit morceau de caramel de faire grossir qui que ce soit? Il regarda son assiette qui était encore à moitié pleine. Si quelque chose avait le potentiel de faire grossir les gens, ça devrait être les immenses quantité de nourriture qu'ils mangeaient à chaque repas. -Je crois que les pattes et la purée de pomme de terre peuvent te rendre encore plus grosse que les bonbons... Répondit-il. -Tu as besoin de glucides et tu peux en avoir en mangeant des pattes, des pommes de terre et du pain ainsi que des aliments semblables et ton corps prend un peu de temps pour les transformer en sucre, et donc tu ne grossis pas en les mangeant sauf si tu en manges plus que tu en ai censé. Les légumes ne contiennent pas beaucoup de sucre, et la viande n'en contient pas du tout. Mais les bonbons son purement fait en sucre et à part si tu es entrain de faire des activités qui brûlent ce sucre rapidement, ton corps va le garder dans sous forme de gras. En y pensant, manger équilibré t'aide à rester en forme parce que tu remplis ton ventre avec des choses qui sont bonnes pour ton corps et tu te sens rassasié et du coup tu ne grignotes pas en mangeant des bonbons. Dit-elle en lui pinçant la joue joyeusement. -Je comprends que les pattes et les pommes de terre me donnent de l’énergie et que les légumes gardent mon ventre en bonne santé mais quel est l’intérêt de la viande. Le petit garçon demanda, sur un ton qui défia ses parents. Bon, il avoua que la viande avait un bon goût en quelques sortes, mais ce n'était pas mieux que les bonbons. -La viande t'aide à grandir . Les gens ayant des muscles impressionnants mangent beaucoup de viande , des poissons et des œufs pour avoir des protéines. Tout comme le lait aide tes os à devenir plus forts, la viande aide tes muscles aussi. Son père répondit en pliant son bras pour montrer son biceps à Jayden. Bon, Jay devait admettre que l'idée d'avoir des muscles comme ceux de son père était vraiment cool et il voulait grandir et devenir fort comme lui. Il regarda son assiette, prit sa fourchette et recommença à manger. Une fois qu'il eut fini son assiette, il regarda son père et demanda: -Alors , on mange quoi pour le dessert? Tout les membres de la famille qui étaient à table secouèrent leur têtes affectueusement. -Une salade de fruits . Son père lui dit et l'expression déçue de Jayden fit rire tout le monde.

Eleanor tapota ses doigts sur son bureau en observant la progression de ses téléchargements sur l’écran de son ordinateur . Elle avait trouvé de très bons jeux en ligne et elle pensait qu'elle allait pouvoir s'amuser en y jouant et passer le temps avec durant ses vacances d'été quand il ferait trop chaud pour sortir jouer dehors. Cependant, après avoir vu les descriptions des jeux, elle devint surexcitée et voulu les essayer immédiatement . Le seul problème était qu'ils prenaient trop de temps pour se télécharger et elle commença à perdre patience . -Arrghhh ! Elle cria avec frustration. Alleeeez ! Plus rapidement, je vous en supplie ! Sa grande sœur qui passait devant sa chambre à ce moment-là devint curieuse et frappa sur la porte ouverte de sa chambre. -Est- ce que je peux entrer ? Demanda-t-elle. -Bien sûr... Répondit Eleanor avec distraction . -Qu'est-ce qui se passe, Elle ? Sa sœur demanda en s’asseyant sur le bord de son lit . -C'est juste cette stupide connexion internet qui est trop lente ! J'attends le téléchargement de ces fichiers depuis des lustres ! La fillette répondit avec rage . Tu es entrain de télécharger des fichiers ? Est-ce qu'ils proviennent d'une source sécurisée ? Sa sœur demanda en mettant une mèche de ses cheveux derrière son oreille et en se penchant en avant pour regarder l’écran de l'ordinateur. Eleanor haussa ses épaules et dit qu'elle n'avait pas vérifié la source en réalité. -Je ne connais même pas la différence entre une source qui est sécurisée et une autre qui ne l'est pas. -Et bien, laisses-moi te montrer. Sa sœur se leva et se mit derrière sa chaise avant de se pencher en avant et de prendre la souris . Elle alla sur un site et utilisa le curseur de la souris pour montrer la partie supérieure du navigateur où le lien du site était écrit. -Tu vois ce cadenas ? Ça veut dire que le site sur lequel tu es est sûr et vérifié . Tout ce que tu télécharges depuis ce site ne va pas faire de mal à ton ordinateur. Elle l'informa avant de lui demander d'aller sur le site depuis lequel elle avait téléchargé ses jeux. -Regarde ! Il y a un cadenas vert ! La fillette dit en montrant du doigt l’icône en question. Sa sœur hocha la tête avant de fermer l'onglet. -Oui, ce site est aussi sécurisé. Donc, tes jeux ne sont pas dangereux. Eleanor hocha la tête, ayant compris. -Qu'est-ce qui se passerait si je télécharge des trucs à partir de sites non vérifiés ? -Et bien, ça dépend. Parfois, rien de grave. Si tu as de la chance rien de mauvais ne se passe mais parfois tu peux avoir des virus sur ton système. Eleanor pencha la tête curieusement sur le côté et demanda à sa sœur ce qu'était un virus et comment fonctionnait-il. -J'entends toujours les gens en parler mais, je n'ai jamais compris ce qu'est vraiment un virus d'ordinateur. -Bon alors, un virus d'ordinateur est un type de logiciels malveillants . Comme d'autres logiciels de ce genre, les virus sont des programmes qui s’exécutent avec d'autres programmes. Dans notre cas, un virus pourrait s’exécuter avec l'un des jeux que tu es entrain de télécharger et se copier sur ton système. Il peut exécuter des instructions dangereuses qui peuvent endommager tes fichiers et ralentir ton ordinateur. -Oh ! C'est ce qui se passe quand on attrape froid , n'est-ce pas ? Ça rentre dans nos corps et nous rend malade et alités.La petite fille remarqua. -Oui ! En fait, c'est la raison pour laquelle ce type de logiciels malveillants est nommé un virus. Car ça marche de la même manière qu'un virus de rhume où de grippe . Sa sœur lui dit. -Tu continues à répéter les mots “Ce type de logiciels malveillants”, quels sont les autres types ? Eleanor demanda en se penchant en avant dans sa chaise. -Et bien, il y a plusieurs autres types. L'un d'eux est un type qu'on appelle un cheval de Troie. Connais-tu l'histoire du cheval de Troie dans l'histoire ? Eleanor secoua la tête, indiquant que non. -Bon, dans la mythologie grecque, on dit que la femme du roi de Sparte, Hélène, avait été kidnappée et emmenée à Troie. Ceci poussa le roi à demander de l'aide auprès des Grecs qui acceptèrent d'aller au secours d’Hélène. Mais, la cité de Troie était protégée avec de grands murs et on ne pouvait pas y accéder facilement et donc le général Grec Ulysse pensa à jouer un tour pour s'y introduire et sauver Hélène avec ses guerriers . Et donc, les Grecs battirent un immense cheval en bois et le laissèrent hors du portail de Troie en guise d'offrande et l'armé fit semblant de battre en retraite. Les gens de Troie, contents de leur victoire , tirèrent le cheval à l’intérieur de la cité et le mirent au centre pour que tout le monde puisse l'admirer. La nuit, quand tout le monde dormait, quelques guerriers qui étaient cachés à l’intérieur du cheval en sortirent et ouvrirent les portails de Troie pour le reste de l'armé et à partir de là, tu peux facilement deviner qui avait gagné cette guerre. Eleanor écouta l'histoire avec fascination avant de demander quel lien ça avait avec le logiciel malveillant. -Le cheval de Troie marche d'une façon semblable . Il se fait passer pour un logiciel inoffensif pour te pousser à le télécharger et l'installer et une fois sur ton système, il peut donner accès aux attaquants à tes fichiers et ils pourront t'espionner , voler  tes fichiers et même télécharger plus de logiciels malveillants sur ton ordinateur. -Oh... C'est horrible ! Eleanor dit en regardant l’écran de son ordinateur. Ses téléchargements étaient toujours en cours et elle retourna son attention sur sa sœur. Comment pourrais-je protéger mon ordinateur des logiciels malveillants ? -Tu peux utiliser un logiciel antivirus . Ils te préviennent en général quand tu es sur le point de télécharger quelque chose de suspect et tu peux même les utiliser pour nettoyer ton ordinateur et te débarrasser des logiciels malveillants qui y sont déjà. Comme je l'ai déjà dit, évite d'aller sur des sites qui ne sont pas vérifiés et sécurisés et ne télécharge rien à partir d’une source inconnue. Et pour être sûre, s’il y a des fichiers importants sur ton ordinateur, fais- en une copie de secours et charge-la sur un drive en ligne ou sur une clé USB juste pour ne pas perdre tes données en cas ou quelque chose arrive à ton système. Eleanor hocha la tête avec enthousiasme et remercia sa sœur pour ses explications. -Tout est plus clair maintenant. Elle se tourna vers son ordinateur et vit que les téléchargements de ses jeux étaient terminés et elle lança leurs installations avec excitation. Maintenant qu'elle était sûre qu'ils n'étaient pas dangereux pour son ordinateur, elle allait s'amuser en y jouant encore plus.

(French Language) (Reading Comprehension) D G (With Answer)

Le soleil baignait le monde dans sa chaleur et sa lumière éclaircit les fleurs en éclosion. Ce beau matin , une petite fille regardait le joli jardin de sa grand-mère depuis le bord de la fenêtre de sa chambre , en tenant un verre de limonade dans sa main. Elle soupira joyeusement après avoir pris une bonne bouffée d'air frais qui portait les douces odeurs des plantes puis, pencha sa tête sur la fenêtre, ayant la paisible sensation d'être chez elle. Soudain, un petit mouvement irrégulier saisit sont attention et elle concentra son regard sur la source de ce mouvement qui était une toute petite araignée suspendue au bout d'un fil qui était emporté par la brise . Felicity rigola sur la scène bizarre qui lui rappela, en fait, un film qu'elle avait regardé il n'y avait pas très longtemps avec ses grands- parents. -Cette araignée parait exactement comme les cambrioleurs qui étaient descendu du plafond pour voler le joyau du musée royal. Pensa-t-elle en regardant le petit insecte s’éloigner d'elle, flottant vers l'inconnu. Elle tourna son regard vers la plante empotée qui était juste sous la fenêtre et regarda une abeille qui avait la tête dans une fleur et elle laissa échapper un rire. -Quelle petite créature loufoque ! Dit-elle en regardant le petit insecte volant se tortiller  pour aller plus profondément dans la fleur. Les abeilles travaillaient tellement dur ! La petite fille soupira et pensa que la vie devait être très intéressante pour les insectes. Elle se demanda ce que ça ferait de voir les choses de leur perspective. Tout devait paraître gigantesque et les petits brins d'herbe qu'elle voyait devaient être une jungle pour les minuscules insectes qui résidaient dans le jardin de sa grand- mère. -Si seulement je pouvais rétrécir pour un jour... Pensa-t-elle en baillant avec paresse juste avant de s'endormir contre la fenêtre. Quand elle se leva, elle était toujours sur le bord de la fenêtre dans la maison de sa grand-mère mais elle était devenue beaucoup plus petite. -Fais attention à ce que tu souhaites, hein... ? Elle murmura à elle- même en regardant autour d'elle avec fascination. Elle ne sentit aucun regret, par contre. Elle était excitée de vivre ce nouveau changement et était impatiente de voir comment sa journée allait se dérouler. Elle passa un peu de temps à observer son entourage . Tout paraissait diffèrent. Le verre de limonade -qui était à présent tiède - dont elle buvait auparavant lui sembla être aussi haut qu'une tour et le bord de la fenêtre paraissait aussi vaste qu'une autoroute. Les rayons de soleil qui percèrent la vitre étaient éblouissants et dégageaient de la chaleur et elle fit en sorte de se mettre dans les endroits les moins intenses. Ce qu'elle crut être une légère brise avant se transforma en un vent soufflant qui lui ébouriffa les cheveux. Quand elle se tourna pour regarder sa chambre, elle ne put pas voir grand-chose au-delà de son vaste lit. L'ours en peluche qui y était se tint comme une statue immense et elle abandonna l'idée d'explorer la chambre le moment où elle l'eut en tête. Elle voulait voir à quoi le monde extérieur ressemblait et elle n'était pas sûre qu'elle allait pouvoir regrimper sur le bord de la fenêtre plus tard si elle en descendit maintenant. Et donc, en se tournant vers la fenêtre, elle la regarda pour voir si elle pourrait trouver le chemin le plus facile pour descendre au jardin et sa recherche fut fructueuse en peu de temps. Elle marcha vers l’extrémité gauche de la fenêtre et testa les petites branches de la plante qui avaient grimpé au long des murs de la maison de ses grands-parents et quand elle était sûre qu'elles étaient assez robustes, elle les utilisa pour descendre. L'odeur de l'herbe fraîchement tendu la frappa et elle marcha à travers le gazon en écartant les brins d'herbe de son chemin avec ses mains. Elle regarda à sa droite et vit des fourmis marcher en queue à un rythme rapide. La plupart des fourmis portaient une sorte de graines qui étaient deux fois plus grandes qu'elles et elle les regarda passer avec admiration. Une fois la parade de fourmis passée, elle reprit son chemin et l'insecte suivant qu'elle vit fut un mille-pattes . Elle laissa échapper un souffle effrayé car l'insecte lui parut beaucoup plus intimidant quand elle était aussi petite et elle décida de ne pas bouger et de garder le silence, faisant semblant de ne pas exister jusqu'à ce que la voie devint libre. Quand l'insecte ayant plus de pattes qu'elle ne put compter passa, elle reprit son chemin autour du jardin. -Wow... Murmura-t-elle, impressionnée en voyant une libellule juste avant qu'elle ne s'envola. Elle était magnifique et elle se sentit chanceuse d'avoir pu la voir de si près. En allant plus loin à travers le jardin, elle rencontra aussi une créature moins jolie. Elle fit la grimace en dégoût alors qu'une limace passa devant elle, laissant une traînée de bave qu'elle devait croiser pour continuer en avant. -Il n'y a rien à faire... Dit-elle à elle- même en mettant un pied au-delà du chemin de bave après l'autre. Mais, tandis qu'elle était occupée à croiser sans mettre les pieds sur la substance dégoûtante, elle ne vit pas la mante religieuse géante qui la guettait et lorsqu'elle se tourna, elle la vit sauter sur elle. Avant qu'elle n'eut le temps de crier, elle se trouva en l'air et quand elle regarda en haut elle ne put voir que les grandes ailes colorés d'un papillon . L'insecte la déposa sur le bord de la fenêtre et inclina la tête avant de s'envoler. -Merci de m'avoir sauvé ! Felicity cria en agitant la main en l'air. Je crois que cela me fait assez d'excitation pour aujourd'hui... Se dit- elle en glissant sur le rideau et avant de grimper sur ses draps. Elle se mit sur son lit à côté de l'ours en peluche géant et décida de prendre une sieste après sa marche fatigante à travers le jardin géant. Elle ferma les yeux et elle sut que lorsqu'elle les ouvrira la prochaine fois, elle aurait regagné sa taille normale.

Le ciel était clair et le soleil brillait. Les oiseaux chantaient avec les criquets, ajoutant une joyeuse mélodie aux couleurs éclatantes de l'été . Les joyeux cris et rires des enfants s'ajoutèrent à cette symphonie tandis qu'ils jouèrent au football dans le parc de leur quartier et tout était parfait jusqu'à ce que l'un d'eux trébucha et fit une horrible chute. -On arrête tout, Riley est tombé ! L'un d'eux cria, causant les autres de s’arrêter au milieu de la partie. Tout le monde se rassembla autour du petit garçon et ils lui demandèrent si il allait bien avec inquiétude . -Oui, je vais bien. Riley dit, en grinçant ses dents à cause de la douleur . -Ton genou saigne, ta blessure à l'air sérieuse. Tu devrais rentrer chez toi. L'un de ses amis suggéra. Riley refusa avec entêtement au début et dit que ce n'était qu'une égratignure avec une expression courageuse. Mais, après que ses amis insistèrent il finit par rentrer chez lui en boitant avec l'aide de l'un des enfants qui habitait près de lui. -Est-ce que tu as très mal? Son ami demanda en le supportant avec un bras autour de son épaule . -Non. Pas vraiment. Ça brûle un peu, c'est tout. J'aurai pu continuer à jouer... Riley répondit avec une grimace en prenant un autre pas. Son amis remarqua qu'il avait clairement mal mais ne le contredit pas et une fois qu’ils étaient arrivés devant la maison de Riley, il lui souhaita un bon rétablissement et lui dit au revoir. - Prends soin de toi ! On a besoin de toi dans l'équipe! -Merci pour ton aide! Riley lui fit un geste de la main en guise d'au revoir et sonna à la porte. Il bougea en faisant attention et mit son poids sur sa jambe qui n'était pas blessée puis prit un grand souffle. La douleur avait commencé à s'intensifier. Alors qu'il attendit qu'on lui ouvre la porte, il se concentra pour s’empêcher de pleurer . Ses yeux avaient commencé à larmoyer mais il ne voulait pas montrer sa faiblesse et il ne voulait pas inquiéter ses parents. -Salut mon chéri. Sa mère le salua avec un sourire qui se transforma en une expression d’inquiétude en voyant son genou qui saignait. Qu'est-ce qui t'est arrivé, Riley?! Demanda-t-elle, horrifiée. -J'ai fait une petite chute en jouant. Dit-il en s’éclaircissant la gorge. -Viens à l’intérieur , mon chou. Laisse-moi voir ta blessure . Dit sa mère en l'aidant. Une fois à l'intérieur, les deux allèrent dans la salle de bain et nettoyèrent la blessure de Riley avant de sécher son genou et d'appliquer une pommade antiseptique sur ses égratignures. Sa mère mit un pansement sur son genou et l'aida pour monter à sa chambre pour qu'il puisse s'allonger et se reposer. Mais lorsqu'elle l'aida pour enlever ses chaussures , elle remarqua que son pied était enflé et après qu'elle le toucha un peu, elle soupçonna qu'il avait foulé sa cheville en trébuchant. Elle appela leur voisin qui était médecin pour la voir et quand ils déterminèrent que ce n'était rien de grave et qu'une visite à l’hôpital n'était pas nécessaire, elle appliqua un peu d'alcool chirurgicale sur son pied et lui fit un bandage. -Tiens, laisse-moi mettre ça sous ton pied. Dit-elle en mettant un petit coussin sous son mollet. Puis, elle se mit à côté de lui sur le bord de son lit et caressa sa joue. -Mon pauvre petit garçon. Tu dois avoir tellement mal. Dit-elle avec un triste sourire. -Non. Je vais bien, Maman. Riley la rassura. -Tu peux exprimer ta douleur, mon chéri. Ça ira. Sa mère lui dit avec un regard complice. D’ailleurs, pleurer peut apaiser ta douleur. -Les garçons ne pleurent pas, Maman. Dit Riley, déterminé . Sa mère fronça ses sourcils , surprise. -C'est n'importe quoi. Dit- elle. Qui est-ce qui t'a dit ça? Riley haussa ses épaules et la regarda comme si c'était trop évident pour en parler. Sa mère soupira et prit un moment avant de reprendre la parole. - Papa est un garçon, n'est-ce pas? -Papa est un homme . Riley déclara avec conviction. Sa mère sourit avec indulgence. -C'est vrai. Papa est un homme, Elle le regarda avec un sourcil levé. Mais il pleur, n'est-ce pas? Riley sourit. -Tout le temps . Répondit-il. -Comme la fois où il avait marché sur un oursin de mer , tu t’en souviens ? Riley rigola et hocha la tête. -Pour être honnête, ça paraissait très douloureux. Il avait crié à chaque fois où tu avais enlevé une des aiguilles avec tes pinces. Sa mère fronça son nez en se rappelant du souvenir avant de secouer sa tête. -Et quand Lisa est morte... Ajouta-t-elle. Riley hocha tristement la tête. Lisa était leur chienne et toute la famille était attristée par sa mort. -Et il y avait cette fois, Sa mère dit avec un sourire d'amusement. Quand ta petite sœur est née . Le petit garçon roula ses yeux au ciel avec un sourire. -Je ne sais pas ce qu'il y avait d'aussi triste cette fois là! Sa mère ria et lui dit que c’étaient probablement des larmes de joie . -La morale c'est que ton père exprime toujours ses sentiments et il n'a pas de problèmes pour pleurer quand il en a besoin. Alors, est- ce que cela fait de lui quelqu'un de faible? Demanda-t-elle. -Non. Papa est l'un des hommes les plus forts que je connais! Riley répondit avec enthousiasme. -Et est-ce que cela fait de lui un homme inférieur ? Il secoua la tête, indiquant qu'il ne pensait pas que c'était le cas. -Alors qu'est-ce qui te fait croire que les garçons ne doivent pas pleurer quand ils ont mal? Demanda-t-elle sur un ton doux et gentil. Il la regarda avec un faible sourire et haussa ses épaules. -Je veut juste être courageux, Maman. -Et c'est très bien mon chéri. Mais être courageux ne veut pas dire retenir ses larmes . Le vrai courage c'est de s'exprimer sans avoir peur de ce que les autres vont penser de nous. Je sais que tu es brave et ton père, ta sœur ainsi que tous tes amis le savent aussi. Même si tu pleurs quand tu as mal. Riley hocha la tête , ayant compris ce qu'elle lui disait. Personne ne lui avait jamais dit qu'il ne pouvait pas pleurer et il avait plein d'amis qui pleuraient quand ils se faisaient mal en jouant. Son visage se relaxa soudainement et son expression indiqua enfin à quel point il avait mal. Il regarda sa mère. -En vérité ça fait vraiment mal, Maman. -Oh, mon chou. Viens là! Sa mère le prit dans ses bras et après quelques moments, Riley eut la sensation que son genou et son pied ne lui faisaient plus aussi mal.

Un beau matin de printemps , tandis que les fleurs étaient en éclosion et que les arbres secouaient leurs belles feuilles vertes, une enseignante annonça à sa classe qu'elle avait imprimé les photos prises durant leur voyage d’étude. -J'ai fait quelques copies pour tout le monde! Leur dit-elle avec un joyeux sourire. Les enfants poussèrent des cris de joie et papotèrent entre eux avec excitation quand ils reçurent les enveloppes contenant les images en question. Freya, une des élèves de cette classe, ouvrit l’enveloppe et regarda les images ayant immortalisé leur sortie avec joie avant de les remettre dans son sac à dos , bien à l'abri entre deux livres pour éviter qu'elles ne se froissent. Elle avait hâte de les montrer à ses parents et elle savait qu'ils les aimeraient autant qu'elle les avait aimé. Une fois chez elle, son père choisit les images qu'il avait jugé les plus joyeuses et les encadra avant de les suspendre avec les autres photos de la famille sur le mur du couloir. -Ton sourire est si grand dans ces photos, ma chérie. Dit-il à Freya alors que les deux admirèrent les photos qui avaient été ajoutées récemment. Elle hocha la tête en accord. Le voyage avait été très amusant et elle n'avait même pas eu besoin de sourire pour les photos vu qu'elle n'avait pas passés un moment sans sourire à travers la journée . Le regard de Freya atterrit sur les autres photos qui étaient sur le mur et elle remarqua qu'elles étaient toutes des photos des membres de sa famille souriant avec joie ou bien même entrain de rire . Chaque photo produit une joyeuse ambiance. -Je me demande si... Murmura-t-elle à elle même quand elle commença à y penser. Maintenant qu'elle avait ça en tête, c'était le cas dans chaque maison où elle avait été: seulement des images ayant des personnes heureuses comme sujets étaient exposés sur les murs, bureaux et cheminées . Pourquoi donc? -Peut être parce que les gens étaient affectés par les photos? Pensa-t-elle en marchant au long du couloir. C'était logique. Le plus de temps qu'elle passa à regarder les photos, le plus sa joie augmentait. Elle vit une image de sa première fois où elle avait attrapé un poisson , quand elle avait accompagné son père au lac et sourit avec fierté. -C'était une très bonne journée... Avoua-t-elle. Puis, elle vit une photo qui avait été prise lorsque toute la famille était partie en voyage sur la route et rigola. C'était tellement amusant malgré que son grand frère avait passé son temps à se plaindre sur le fait qu'il n'y avait pas d'internet. La photo suivante qu'elle admira avait été prise lors de sa fête d’anniversaire . La famille avait organisé la fête dans un restaurant et tous ses amis avaient été invités. C'était tellement élégant et la nourriture était délicieuse et elle avait adoré chaque moment. Elle se rappela qu'ils l'avaient taquiné en mettant de la crème chantilly sur son visage et rigola sur ce souvenir. Ce n'était pas surprenant que ces photos étaient là, chacune d'elle reflétait des souvenirs heureux et inspiraient un sentiment de joie chez la personne qui les regardait. Voulant explorer d'autres aspects de sa théorie, elle demanda à son père de lui donner l'album familiale pour qu'elle puisse regarder les autres photos qui n'avaient pas mérité un emplacement d'honneur sur le mur. Quand elle commença à feuilleter l'album, quelques unes la firent rire à haute voix et quelques unes la firent grimacer tandis que certaines la rendirent nostalgique et un peu triste . La photo prise d'elle à l'age de quatre ans vêtue d'un costume de fée et tenant une baguette magique la fit rigoler. Elle adorait se déguiser et mettre des costumes ridicules comme celui-là quand elle était plus jeune et elle jouait toujours le rôle du personnage ayant inspiré sont déguisement. Toute la famille lui avait dit qu'elle se baladait autour de la maison en les touchant avec la baguette magique et en leur disant qu'elle venait d’exhausser leurs vœux et malgré qu'elle se rappela à peine de cette journée, elle trouva quand même l'anecdote amusante. Une autre image qui n'était pas aussi drôle captura son attention. C'était une photo d'elle avec le visage enflé et avec une vilaine rougeur. Elle avait mangé des noix pour la première fois et il s'était avéré qu'elle était allergique. -J'ai l'air tellement bizarre... Murmura-t-elle à elle même en regardant son visage tout rouge et ses yeux larmoyants. Je suis tellement contente que cette photo n'est pas sur le mur d'honneur! Soupira-t-elle en secouant la tête. Si ce n'était pas pour la crainte d’énerver ses parents, elle aurait jeté cette photo dans la poubelle . Elle pouvait s'imaginer faire la grimace à chaque fois qu'elle passerait par le couloir si cette photo y était. C'était une image qui n'inspira pas de joie en elle du tout. Une autre photo l’arrêta et elle passa un moment à la regarder. C'était une image de sa vieille maison. Avant que sa famille ne déménagea et ne s'installa dans leur maison actuelle, ils vivaient dans une très belle maison avec un grand jardin et une cabane sur un arbre . Elle adorait y vivre et jouer dans la cabane avec ses anciens amis et cet endroit lui manquait tellement. C'était tellement dommage qu'ils durent quitter cette maison à cause du travail de son père. Malgré qu'elle avait aimé cet endroitFreya était contente de ne pas s'en souvenir chaque jour. Elle n'aimait pas trop le sentiment de nostalgie qu'elle ressentait en pensant à ces jours passés. La dernière photo qu'elle avait regardé avant de fermer l'album était une photo de son grand-père décédé . Freya l'aimait tellement et elle était si triste de ne plus jamais pouvoir le voir. Sa mère lui avait dit qu'ils se souviendraient toujours de lui et qu'ils l'aimeraient à jamais et qu'il ne les avait pas vraiment quitté du moment qu'ils pensaient à lui mais la petite fille ne put s’empêcher de ressentir de la tristesse en regardant sa photo. Comme celle de son ancienne maison, elle pensait qu'il était pour le bien de tout le monde de ne pas voir cette image souvent à cause de la peine qu'elle ressentait en la regardant même si elle l'aimait très fort. -Je comprends maintenant pourquoi seules les photo joyeuses sont sur le mur. Dit-elle avant de retourner en bas et de donner l'album à son père. -Les photos ne nous rappellent pas seulement les souvenirs du passés mais aussi les sentiments qu'on avait ressentit quand elles avaient été prises.

Caleb sortit de la voiture avec grande excitation. Il allait avoir un animal de compagnie aujourd'hui! Il faillit trébucher sur le vide en marchant rapidement vers le magasin d'animaux. Le magasin où son père l'avait emmené était un endroit qui permettait d’adopter des animaux sauvés. On peut avoir n'importe quel animal que l'on veut mais on doit faire un don à l'association qui les sauve en retour. La somme du don n'était pas importante, l'association considérait déjà l'adoption des animaux comme un acte merveilleux et donc n'imposa pas de sommes spécifiques. Caleb avait joyeusement brisé sa tire-lire et avait ramené ses économies avec lui et son père lui avait dit qu'il allait aussi faire un don pour le magasin et donc, c'était avec une grande joie que les deux se dirigèrent là-bas. Caleb et son père entrèrent dans le magasin et ils n'étaient même pas complètement à l’intérieur avant que les yeux du petit garçon ne s’élargissent, tellement il était impressionné . -Whoa... Exclama-t-il. Le magasin était pratiquement un royaume pour toute sorte d'animaux domestiques . Il y avait plein de petits paniers où des chatons, des chiots et des hamsters étaient blottis l'un contre l'autre entrain de jouer ou de dormir . Sur une étagère, il y avait un grand aquarium avec des poissons colorés et de toutes petites tortues. Il y avait même une petite volière d’intérieur dans un coin du magasin avec de différents types d'oiseaux qui chantaient joyeusement, ajoutant un agréable son à la merveilleuse scène. L'un des murs du magasin était dédié à la nourriture pour animaux ainsi qu'à des gamelles, des coussins et des jouets en caoutchouc. C'était pratiquement un petit paradis pour les animaux ainsi que les gens qui en étaient fans et Caleb ne s'était jamais sentit aussi heureux. Oh, il ne pouvait pas attendre pour parler à ses amis de cet endroit. Ils allaient être tellement jaloux ! Il fit son chemin à travers les chiots, s'assurant de caresser chacun d'eux avant de se tourner vers les chatons et de leur donner des petites caresses sur le ventre . Il prit ensuite son temps pour admirer le bel aquarium et se sentit heureux rien qu'en regardant ses habitants nager à l’intérieur.Leurs jolis motifs colorés étaient tellement bizarres mais tellement beaux ! Quelques moments après il se dirigea vers la petite volière pour admirer les oiseaux qui étaient dedans. Ils avaient tous l'air tellement doux avec leurs jolies plumes et leurs visages ronds. -Celui-là est si grand! Dit-il à haute voix en voyant un perroquet. Cependant, il oublia vite la taille de l’oiseau quand celui-ci répéta ses mots avec une voix aiguë . -Raaa, si grand! Si grand! Caleb rigola en entendant le son de l'oiseau. Il savait que les perroquets pouvaient faire ça mais entendre l'un d'eux parler en réalité était quand même bizarre. Il se demanda ce que ça ferait si ces oiseaux pouvaient en réalité avoir une conversation avec leurs propriétaires au lieu de juste répéter leurs mots. D’ailleurs, il regarda autour de lui et vit les autres animaux, il était curieux de voir comment la vie serait s'ils pouvaient tous parler . Il regarda les chiots et sut exactement ce qu'ils diraient. -Caresse- moi! Caresse-moi! Caresse-moi! Dis-moi que je suis un bon chien! Il imagina qu'un chien dirait un truc pareil en secouant la queue avec excitation. Le chien de sa tante courrait toujours envers lui quand il la visitait et il ne se lassait pas de jouer avec qui que ce soit qui lui accordait son attention. -Que dirait un poisson ...? Il se demanda à haute voix en regardant l'aquarium. Il regarda les poissons rouges qui nageaient avec paresse à l’intérieur pour un long moment et se rappela de l'information incorrecte qui disait qu'un poisson rouge avait une mémoire qui dure trois secondes. Il savait que c'était faux mais il croyait que ça aurai été drôle d'avoir une conversation avec un poisson si l'information était vraie. -Salut! Comment vas-tu ? Il s'imagina dire au poisson rouge. -Salut. Je vais bien et toi? Le poisson répondrait en nageant en cercles. -Je vais très bien. Comment va ta journée? -Salut, Très Bien. Quelle journée? Le poisson aurait répondu en clignant ses grands yeux avec confusion . Caleb se mit à rigoler sur son interaction imaginaire avec le poisson. Il se demandait vraiment ce que dirait un poisson, sérieusement. Probablement quelque chose comme -Donne-moi à manger. Il ne pouvait pas imaginer autre chose. On ne peut pas caresser un poisson et on ne peut sûrement pas lui jeter une balle pour qu'il aille la chercher . Le truc le plus amusant qu'il avait vu un poisson faire était une petite chasse avec les flocons de nourriture qui avaient été jetés dans son aquarium. Il regarda un des oiseaux dans la volière et l'observa tandis que celui-ci bougea sa tête droite et gauche en regardant curieusement autour de lui, en poussant des sifflements et en sautant un peu partout. -Il parait intelligent... mais un peu agité. -Quoi? Quoi? C'est quoi ce bruit? C'est quoi ça? Est-ce que ça se mange? Il imagina le canari dire en lui picorant la main. Qui es-tu? Est-ce que je te connais? Je veux chanter. Chantons. Chante avec moi. L'oiseau ensuite commencerait à chanter joyeusement. Il se tourna vers les chatons qui jouaient et imagina comment une conversation avec l'un d'eux se passerait. -Salut, petit chaton. Coucou. Salut. Il répéterait en essayant d'attirer l'attention du chaton tandis que celui-ci serait entrain de lécher son pelage. -Salut. Je m'excuse de ne pas avoir répondu plus tôt, j'étais occupé. Le chaton lui répondrait enfin après avoir fini sa toilette. -Ce n'est pas grave. Tu veux jouer? Le chaton le regarderait ensuite avant de dire non. Puis il demanderait s’il pourrait toucher un de ses coussinets et le chaton refuserait. -Mais tu peux me gratter le ventre si tu me donne quelque chose à manger. Le chaton dirait. Caleb, donnerait bien sûr des gâteries au chaton et le regarderait manger patiemment avant d'enfin pouvoir le caresser. -As-tu décidé lequel tu veux adopter? La voix de son père lui dit, le sortant de son rêve. Caleb regarda autour de lui avant de faire face à son père de nouveaux. -Euh, pas encore. Je vais peut être avoir besoin d'aide.

Les sons assourdis des gouttes d'eau tapant sur le toit étaient le seul bruit qui raisonnait dans la maison. Oliver se tourna droite et gauche dans son lit et ne parvint pas à s'endormir. Le courant était coupé à cause de la tempête et il ne pouvait même pas allumer la télévision. Sa chambre était sombre , éclairée que par la lumière de l'éclair occasionnellement. Il laissa échapper un soupir misérable, il était tellement ennuyé et même un peu effrayé. Il se leva et fit son chemin à travers sa chambre lentement pour aller à la chambre de son frère et malheureusement, il se cogna le pied contre le cadre de la porte. -Ouille! Murmura-t-il, n'osant pas parler à haute voix. Quand il arriva enfin à la porte de son frère, des bruits forts de quelqu'un qui frappait à la porte le fit sursauter . Qui pourrait bien leur rendre visite à cette heure? Et au bon milieu d'une tempête? Oh, non... Oliver avait vu assez de films d'horreur pour savoir comment ça allait finir! Son frère ouvrit la porte de sa chambre , le faisant sursauter de surprise. -Qu'est-ce que tu fais là, mon grand? Son frère demanda. -Je m'ennuyais... Oliver dit en haussant les épaules . -Est-ce qu'on vient de frapper à la porte? J'avais mes écouteurs aux oreilles et donc je ne suis pas sûr. Oliver hocha la tête et jeta un regard aux escaliers avec agitation. La personne qui avait frappé à la porte venait de le refaire et ne s’arrêta pas cette fois-ci. Ses parents choisirent ce moment là pour quitter leur chambre. -Pourquoi êtes-vous debout à cette heure? Leur mère demanda avec mécontentement tandis que leur père descendit l'escalier pour voir qui frappait à leur porte. Les deux garçons ne répondirent pas et l’aîné suivit son père en bas. Oliver préféra rester avec sa mère et quand les deux entendirent le bruit de la porte qu'on ouvrait, il descendirent avec hésitation pour voir qui était leur visiteur impatient. -Julie?! Sa mère demanda avec étonnement en voyant une femme tremblante devant de la porte enlever son manteau trempé. -Quelle tempête! La femme dit, son visage crispé et contrarié. -Qu'est-ce qui t'as fait venir à cette heure? La mère d'Oliver demanda. Mais c'était son père qui prit la parole. -J'étais entrain de lui poser la même question. -Je voulais vous surprendre. Je viens de rentrer de mon voyage et j'ai conduit une voiture de location jusqu’ici. Comme une idiote, je n'ai pas vu la météo et le motel où j'avais prévu rester sur mon chemin était complet et donc je n'avais pas d'autres choix que de continuer à conduire malgré que je savais que j'allais arriver à cette heure inappropriée. La dame expliqua rapidement. Le temps qu'il faisait l'avait clairement rendu de mauvaise humeur . Oliver regarda son frère et vit que comme lui, il était surprit de voir cette dame ici. Peut être qu'il ne savait pas qui c'était non plus? Il allait devoir lui demander plus tard. Le petit garçon fronça ses sourcils et la regarda de la tête aux pieds. Elle était habillée complètement en noir : des pantalons noirs, une blouse noir, un manteau noir et des bottes noirs. Même ses cheveux étaient noirs d'après ce qu'il pouvait voir grâce à la torche de son père. -Et je vois qu'il n'y a pas de courant en plus. Génial! Dit la dame avec amertume. -Viens avec moi, je vais te donner des serviettes pour te sécher les cheveux. Je suppose que tu as ramener tes vêtements avec toi? La mère d’Oliver lui demanda. -Oui, mais il n'y a aucune chance que je ressorte sous la pluie pour les chercher de la voiture! Julie répondit en tremblant. -Tu devrais lui prêter quelque chose pour ce soir, ma chérie. Je vais faire chauffer de l'eau pour une tasse de thé bien chaud. Le papa d’Oliver suggéra et quand leur invité marcha en avant pour aller avec sa mère, elle vit le petit garçon.-Oh, salut petit. Tu dois être Oly. Dit-elle. -Oliver. Il la corrigea. -D’accord. Et bien, à demain. Et sur ce, elle s'en alla. Le père d'Oliver lui demanda à lui et à son frère de retourner en haut et les deux garçons obéirent. En montant, Oliver demanda à son frère si il avait déjà entendu parler de cette personne. Était-elle un membre éloigné de la famille ou un truc du genre? -C'est l'amie de maman de l'université , elles étaient inséparables et elles sont restées en contact. La seule autre fois où elle est venue était quand tu était un petit bébé, c'est pour ça que tu ne te rappelle pas d'elle. Le plus âgé des deux garçon expliqua. Oliver n'avait pas du tout aimé cette dame. Il la trouva suspicieuse . Il était clair que ses parents la connaissaient et ils se comportaient comme s’ils lui faisaient confiance, la laissant entrer chez eux et tout, mais il avait un mauvais pré-sentiment la concernant. Oliver lâcha soudainement un souffle horrifié en ayant une pensée effrayante. Et si cette femme étaient en réalité une sorcière métamorphe qui s'était fait passer pour l'amie de maman?! Oh, non! Et quand tout le monde serait endormi, elle les tuerait tous! Il entendit les voix de sa mère et de la fausse Julie parler tandis qu'elle s'installa dans la chambre d'invités et décida d'aller la confronter quand ses parents retourneraient dans leur chambre. Il attendit une demi-heure environ et quand il était sûr que la voie était libre, il se faufila hors de sa chambre en silence. La porte de la chambre d'invités était légèrement ouverte et il vit qu'il y avait une bougie allumée à l’intérieur. La lumière produite par la flamme projeta des ombres intenses contre le mur et il put voir la silhouette courbée de la fausse Julie qui était assise sur le lit à un angle étrange et il entendit les sons de toux et de crachats. Elle était sûrement entrain de reprendre sa forme d'origine! Il ouvrit la porte, faisant tourner Fausse Julie envers lui avec un sursaut. -Oh, c'est toi! Tu m'as fais peur, petit! Dit-elle avec une main sur sa poitrine. Elle avait toujours apparence humaine et en marchant à l’intérieur de la chambre, il vit qu'elle tenait une serviette en papier. Julie avait un sourire penaud aux lèvres et elle mit un doigt devant eux. -Ne dis pas à ton père mais, ce thé est dégueulasse ! Oliver comprit que le son qu'il avait entendu était fait par elle en crachant le thé dans le mouchoir et il rigola d’amusement. Le thé de son père était infecte, il le savait par expérience! -Hé, tu veux un peu de chocolat? Je l'ai apporté avec moi de mon voyage en Suisse! Julie dit en sortant une barre de chocolat de son sac. -Ne dis pas à ta maman, par contre. Je suis sûre qu'elle n’approuverait pas du fait que tu manges des sucreries la nuit. Elle lui fit un clin d’œil avec un sourire espiègle. Oliver prit la barre de chocolat et s'assied sur le lit à coté d'elle. -Tu as été en Suisse? Demanda-t-il avec curiosité. -Ouai. Tu veux voir des photos? Elle n’attendit pas sa réponse et prit son téléphone de la table de chevet. Olivier passa la nuit avec qui il appela maintenant Tante Julie, il avait écouté ses histoires sur ses voyages autour du monde et sur le temps qu'elle avait passé avec sa mère à l'université quand elles étaient plus jeunes. Quand il s’endormit, sa dernière pensée était que Tante Julie était la plus gentille, la plus cool et la plus drôle des sorcières métamorphes au monde!

-N'oublie pas ton parapluie ma chérie. La météo a annoncé qu'il allait peut être pleuvoir aujourd'hui aussi. Madame Sanders dit à sa fille depuis la cuisine en l'entendant ouvrir la porte . -Oui, maman! Amy répondit en prenant son parapluie du porte- manteau où il était posé. La fillette mit ses bras dans les bretelles de son cartable et arrangea son bonnet en laine avant de quitter la maison. En route à l'école, elle chantonna doucement en sautant au delà des flaques d'eau produites par la pluie de la nuit passée. Elle regarda le ciel et vit les nuages gris qui indiquaient que sa mère avait raison de prêter tant d'attention à la météo. Si les nuages dans le ciel indiquaient quoi que ce soit, c'était qu'il allait pleuvoir à travers la journée. Amy commença à balancer son parapluie en pensant aux présentateurs de la météo. Est-ce qu'ils devaient voyager partout à travers le monde pour voir quel temps il allait faire là-bas? Si c'était le cas, la petite fille pensa que c'était le travail le plus cool au monde . Comme ça devait être super de voyager partout juste pour voir le ciel et de dire aux gens de ne pas oublier de mettre leurs manteaux ou d'annuler leurs plans de pic-nique! Ou bien, peut être qu'ils allaient dans l’espace pour faire leur travail? C'était logique, vu qu'ils seraient plus capables de voir comment les nuages bougeaient d'en haut , n'est-ce pas? Ça aussi c'était très cool, par contre! Le fait de porter ces combinaisons d'espace et de monter sur une navette spatial serait génial! Ou bien... est-ce qu'il communiquaient simplement avec les extraterrestres qui leur disaient comment les choses allaient progresser sur terre?! Amy s’arrêta de marcher et laissa échapper un souffle en pensant à ça. Si c'était le cas, alors les extraterrestres existent vraiment! Elle vit un groupe d'oiseaux voler loin de la ville et se souvint que leur enseignant leur avait dit une fois qu'ils migraient vers des régions plus chaudes . Mais comment savaient-ils quand il allait faire plus froid ? Avaient-ils des diffusions de météo aussi? Elle rigola et reprit son chemin. Cette pensée était ridicule! Mais elle était très curieuse sur comment un présentateur de météo faisait son travail et elle décida de poser la question à son enseignant avant la récréation. Une fois arrivée en classe, Amy compta les minutes avec impatience, ayant hâte de poser ses questions et de résoudre le mystère qu'elle avait en tête depuis ce matin. Quand la cloche sonna enfin, elle se dirigea rapidement vers le bureau de l'enseignant et demanda quelques moments de son temps . -Comment savent les présentateurs de la météo quand et où il va pleuvoir et quand il va faire beau et tout? Demanda-t-elle quand il lui prêta son attention. -Et bien, tout d'abord, tu dois connaître la différence entre un présentateur de météo et un météorologiste. Son enseignant lui dit avant de commencer son explication . Les présentateurs de météo sont des gens qui présentent la météo sur la télévision. Ils reçoivent des rapports et les lisent en indiquant des endroits du pays sur l'écran. Les météorologistes sont les gens qui préparent ces rapports. Ce sont des savants qui étudient le climat et la météo et font des prédictions sur quel temps il va faire au futur. Amy hocha la tête, intéressée . -Et, comment font-ils ces prédictions? -Ils utilisent des informations sur l'état de la météo au passé et mesurent son état actuel au présent et ils devinent son état au futur en se basant sur ça. Amy fronça ses sourcils , son enseignant n'avait pas vraiment tout expliqué. -D'accord, mais comment est-ce qu'ils obtiennent les informations dont ils ont besoin ? Est-ce qu'il leur suffit de regarder le ciel ou...? -Oh! Ils utilisent des outils comme des thermomètres pour mesurer la température, des baromètres pour mesurer la pression de l'air et les anémomètres pour mesurer la vitesse du vent. Ils utilisent aussi des images prises à partir de satellites pour observer la distribution des nuages dans le ciel. Quand ils ont les données nécessaires, ils les introduisent dans des ordinateurs qui utilisent des équations spéciales pour faire des calculs qui produisent par la suite des modèles qui les aident à prédire la météo. Ces modèles ne sont pas toujours précis par contre et les savants doivent les réviser pour voir s'ils sont cohérents où pas. Il est très important que la météo soit aussi précise que possible parce que non seulement elle nous dit quand il va pleuvoir pour qu'on évite d'être trempés , elle nous prévient aussi quand il va y avoir de dangereux phénomènes comme des ouragans et elle nous aide à rester en sécurité . Les fermiers , les marins et les pilotes comptent beaucoup sur la météo dans leur travail et même les sportifs. Les yeux d'Amy s'élargirent par confusion. -Comment est-e que la météo peut affecter le travail de ces gens? -Et bien, les fermiers ont besoin de savoir s’il va pleuvoir pour planter les graines appropriées. Quelques plantes grandissent dans des environnements pluviales et d'autres ne peuvent pas survivre si le temps est trop humide. Les marins ont besoin de savoir s’il va y avoir des tempêtes pour prendre leurs précautions et rester en sécurité à la mer . Et c'est la même chose pour les pilotes, ils ne peuvent pas faire voler des avions dans des conditions météorologique difficiles et les sportifs ne peuvent pas jouer comme il le faut sous la pluie, tu imagines ce que ça ferait de jouer dans un terrain glissant ? Amy rigola en imaginant les grands joueurs de football américain que son père aimait regarder glisser dans la boue en courant à travers le terrain . Elle n'aimerait pas être à leur place! Et rien qu'en pensant au mal de mer et à la nausée qu'on peut avoir en étant dans un bateau qui bascule la fit faire une grimace. Elle n'avait jamais vraiment réalisé à quel point la météo était importante et malgré qu'elle était un peu déçue par le fait que ni les présentateurs ni les météorologistes ne voyageaient ni allaient dans l’espace pour faire leurs recherches, elle pensait quand même que c'était un métier très intéressant. Tellement intéressant, d’ailleurs, qu'elle voulût en savoir plus et il n'y avait pas de meilleur endroit pour commencer que la bibliothèque . -Merci beaucoup pour vos explications, Monsieur Brown! Dit-elle avec enthousiasme avant de prendre sa carte de bibliothèque et de courir hors de la salle de classe. Elle avait juste assez de temps pour obtenir quelques livres avant la fin de la récréation!

Marty était très content de passer la journée chez son ami . Les deux enfants passèrent la matinée à jouer au football dans le jardin et passèrent même un peu de temps avec le chien avant de rentrer dans la maison pour déjeuner et quand ils allèrent à l'étage dans la chambre de son ami pour passer le reste de la journée à jouer aux jeux vidéos, un petit carnet attira l'attention de Marty. -C'est quoi ça, sur ton bureau ? Demanda-t-il en regardant l'objet. -Oh! C'est une collection de timbres . Son ami répondit. Mon père reçoit des lettres de partout dans le monde de ses correspondants. Je ne sais pas pourquoi ils n'utilisent pas simplement le téléphone ou les e-mails, mais à chaque fois qu'il reçoit une lettre, il me laisse prendre le timbre de l’enveloppe. Je les trouve très cool et donc j'ai commencé à les collectionner il y a environ un an. Jettes y un coup d’œil si tu veux! Marty, intrigué par le concept de collectionner des petits morceaux de papier accepta l'offre de son ami et commença à feuilleter les pages du carnet. Il regarda les timbres avec fascination. Quelques uns avaient des images de personnes sur eux, d'autres avaient des paysages tandis que certains avaient des machines, des trains et des animaux. Il avait aimé les couleurs des timbres mais ce qui l’intéressa le plus était la collection en elle même. Les seules choses qu'il avait collectionné dans sa vie étaient des armures dans un jeu et malgré qu'il s'en était venté devant ses amis, il ne pensait pas que c'était aussi intéressant que la collection de timbres de son ami qui resta dans sa tête jusqu'à ce qu'il rentra chez lui. En réalité, il avait vraiment envie de commencer une collection à lui. Mais... que pouvait-il collectionner? À ce qu'il savait, aucun de ses parents n'avaient de correspondants étrangers qui leur envoyaient des lettres et donc, il ne pouvait pas collectionner des timbres. Il supposa qu'il pouvait collectionner ce qu'il voulait et c'était bien ça le problème, il n'avait aucune idée sur quoi choisir ! Il s'installa devant son ordinateur et chercha quelques idées en ligne. Certaines personnes collectionnaient des fleurs séchés apparemment, ce qui ne l’intéressa pas vraiment car les seules fleurs qu'il y avait dans le jardin de sa maison étaient des roses. Il trouva aussi des gens qui collectionnaient des pièces de monnaie provenant de différents pays, c'était intéressant mais il ne voyageait pas et donc cette option avait été abandonnée. Certaines personnes collectionnaient des bandes dessinées et il pensa qu'il préférait regarder des dessins animés au lieu de lire des bandes dessinées et les acheter rien que pour les collectionner était du gâchis . L'un des objets collectionnés les plus bizarres qu'il trouva étaient des papillons . Oui, Certaines personnes collectionnaient des papillons. -Argh, c'est tellement flippant... Murmura-t-il à lui même. Il ne savait pas vraiment pourquoi les gens voudraient garder des cadavres de papillons chez eux mais en y pensant, les collections des fleurs séchées étaient presque la même chose . Il vit aussi qu'il était possible de collectionner des pierres minérales et des cristaux mais il n'était pas vraiment intéressé par ce type d'objets et il ne voulait pas aller en randonnée pour les trouver. L’une des choses les plus intéressantes que les gens collectionnaient étaient les médailles et il trouva ça très cool, il les collectionnerait peut être une fois que son équipe de foot à l'école commencera les compétitions. Pour l'instant, il allait continuer à chercher . Dans un article, il lu qu'on peut collectionner n'importe quoi, du moment que c'est quelque chose que l'on aime et qu'il n y avait pas de regèles . Les gens collectionnaient des trucs qu'ils aimaient et qui les amusaient. Il passa quelques instants à penser à ce qu'il aimait le plus et les seules choses auxquelles il pouvait pensé étaient les jeux vidéos, le football, le chocolat et le skating. Il ne pouvait pas exactement collectionner les jeux vu qu'il les téléchargeait en ligne et le foot était un sport, pas quelque chose que l'on collectionne! Mais... il pouvait collectionner des ballons . - Trop grands... il se dit en secouant la tête . Il n'avait pas assez d'espace dans sa chambre où il pourrait les garder . La même chose s'appliquait pour les skateboards. Et ils étaient trop chers en plus. La seule chose qui restait était le chocolat. Marty fronça les sourcils, ça serait vraiment du gâchis d'acheter des friandises juste pour les mettre dans une boite , alors là le chocolat. Et, pour être honnête, il ne se faisait pas confiance pour ne pas les manger immédiatement après les avoir acheté. C'était juste trop bon! Par contre, le chocolat était très varié et avait beaucoup de formes et de parfums, les variétés étaient presque infinies! Et donc, ça serait quelque chose d’intéressant à collectionner. Humm, que faire? Il eut soudainement une idée qui pourrait régler ses problèmes. Il pourrait simplement collectionner les emballages ! Oui, tous les types de chocolat étaient emballés ou dans une boite. Comme ça il pourra manger le chocolat et collectionner les emballages. Tout le monde gagne! -Je suis un génie! Il pensa avec fierté . Il ouvrit un tiroir et y fouilla pour un moment avant d'en sortir une barre de chocolat qu'il y avait gardé. -Ça va être le premier élément de ma collection. Dit-il avant d'aller sur son bureau et de prendre un carnet neuf. -Je vais coller les emballages ici. Il avait pensé que l'idée de son ami de garder les timbres dans un carnet était intelligente et il voulait faire la même chose . Il prépara du ruban adhésif et un feutre pour noter la date du jour et écrire une petite note et il déballa la barre de chocolat. Il savoura son goût sucré et une fois qu'il en avait fini, il utilisa une lingette pour nettoyer les quelques endroits où il y avait du chocolat fondu collé à l’intérieur de l’emballage et une fois que le tout avait séché, il étendit l'emballage et le mit sur une page du carnet avant de l'y fixer avec du ruban adhésif. Il écrit avec son feutre sur la page sous l’emballage et ferma le carnet avec un sourire satisfait. Il resta en place pour un moment avant de courir hors de sa chambre pour parler à ses parents de son nouveau loisir. Après tout, il avait besoin de leur support pour acheter le chocolat et étendre sa collection! Ses parents étaient amusés et après qu'il eut promis d'être responsable et de ne pas manger trop de chocolat, ils approuvèrent.

(French Language) (Reading Comprehension) D G (With Answer)

Tôt le matin, Monsieur Adler entra dans la classe et salua ses élèves avec grande joie. Il aimait vraiment enseigner et jouer un rôle dans l’éducation des futurs dirigeants du monde. Il aimait leur apprendre de nouvelles choses et se réjouit de voir quand ils firent preuve d'avoir apprit leurs leçons , que cela soit en utilisant de nouveaux mots qu'ils avaient apprit ou par la résolution correcte d'une équation mathématique . Étant quelqu'un qui passait la majorité de sa journée avec ces enfants, il connaissait bien ses petits apprentis et il savait que certaines leçons étaient plus à leurs goûts que d'autres. Par exemple, bien qu'ils avaient aimé la session de lecture d'hier, il savait que la leçon de mathématique d'aujourd'hui n'allait pas être reçue avec beaucoup d'enthousiasme. Et, comme il avait deviné, la réaction des élèves variait de soupirs déçus à quelques plaintes que les mathématiques étaient ennuyeuses. M. Adler posa son menton sur sa main et réfléchit pour quelques minutes. Il regarda hors de la fenêtre et fit une grimace en voyant la pluie. Les enfants n'allaient pas pouvoir sortir dehors pour la récréation et il ne voulait pas que leurs humeurs deviennent pires en étudiant quelque chose qui ne les amusait pas en plus du fait de ne pas pouvoir sortir pour jouer. Il voulait que l'école soit un endroit amusant pour eux et il décida de faire preuve de compassion. Il pourrait retarder la leçon d'une heure environs. -Bon, d'accord. Alors, que dites vous de ceci: Il commença en se penchant sur son bureau . Et si vous jouez le rôle d'enseignant pour cette session? Les enfants se regardèrent en confusion avant de tourner leur attention sur lui et lui demander ce qu'il voulait dire par ça. -Et bien, je veux que chacun de vous nous enseigne quelque chose. Vous allez avoir cinq minutes chacun pour nous enseigner ce que vous voulez. Juste un petit truc simple que vous savez faire. -Ohhh! C'est beaucoup plus intéressant que d'additionner des nombres ! L'un des enfants dit, poussant les autres à parler en même temps pour exprimer leur accord avec lui. -Allons, les enfants. M. Adler les calma. Nous allons quand même avoir notre cours de math après. Il les informa avec un regard ferme mais pas cruel.Vous avez dix minutes pour penser à un sujet, utilisez votre temps avec sagesse . Les enfants tournèrent leur attention vers leurs cahiers et commencèrent à écrire des notes et des étapes sur de différents sujets. Chacun d'eux avait prit la tâche très sérieusement et lorsque leurs dix minutes s'étaient écoulées, ils avaient tous fini leurs petits plans de leçons. La première personne qui était montée au tableau était une petite fille . Elle demanda à l'enseignant de lui donner un marqueur avant de dire à ses camarades qu'elle allait leur apprendre comment dessiner un ours en peluche . -Tout d’abord, vous devez dessiner un grand cercle avec un cercle plus petit sur lui en haut. C'est le corps et la tête de l'ours en peluche. Elle expliqua en dessinant les cercles en question. -Vous pouvez dessiner avec moi si vous voulez. Dit-elle au dessus de son épaule. -Puis, dessinez deux demi cercles en haut sur les coté du cercle du haut. Ce sont les oreilles. Deux petits cercles sur le bas des deux coté du grand cercles, qui sont les pieds. Elle continua à dessiner pour leur montrer et quelques-uns des enfants dessinaient avec elle sur leurs cahier. -Pour dessiner les bras, faites deux ellipses sur les cotés du corps, dessinez-les à moitié à l’intérieur du grand cercle pour faire en sorte que l’ourson tient son ventre. M.Adler dût s’empêcher de rire . Lucy, la fillette qui était entrain de donner sa leçon était adorable et il était très fier d'elle. -Maintenant, donnons des yeux et une bouche à l’ourson. Dessinez un cercle sur la partie inférieur de la tête et un autre plus petit sur lui en haut pour faire le nez. Dessinez une ligne qui descend du nez et pour dessiner la bouche, dessinez un numéro trois allongé sur son dos comme ça! Maintenant, dessinez deux cercles en haut pour faire des yeux et deux arcs pour les sourcils et vous avez fini! M.Adler devait avouer que son élève avait dessiné un ourson en peluche très mignon sur le tableau et il pouvait clairement voir que les autres élèves avaient aimé la leçon. -Merci beaucoup, Lucy. Dit-il en l'applaudissant ce qui poussa les autres enfants à l'applaudir aussi. L'enfant suivant qui devait enseigner les autres était un garçon nommé Colin. -Je vais vous apprendre comment faire un avion en papier et comment le faire voler très haut. Il commença ensuite à plier une feuille qu'il avait emmener avec lui au tableau. Quand il avait enfin fini de la former en avion, il démontra le geste correct de sa main pour le lancer. -Merci, Colin. Tes camarades ont l'air d'avoir beaucoup aimé ta leçon. M. Adler lui dit avec amusement en regardant les enfants lancer les avions en papier haut dans l'air. Après cela, une fille monta et déclara qu'elle allait apprendre à ces camarades comment faire une tresse . -Je vais avoir besoin d'un volontaire. Katie, tes cheveux sont longs, tu veux bien venir et me laisser les tresser pour montrer aux autres? Et c'était ainsi qu'une heure et demi se déroulèrent. Les enfants avaient chacun un talent intéressant à enseigner. L'un d'eux avait utilisé ses lacets pour leur montrer comment faire des nœuds de marins, une autre apprit à ses camarade comment utiliser les mots "Quand" et "Quant" correctement , ce qui avait beaucoup impressionné M. Adler et il y avait même un enfant qui avait montré aux autres comment faire leurs cartes de fête des mères eux- mêmes. Quand tout le monde eut son tour, l'enseignant se leva et s’éloigna de son bureau. -Merci beaucoup, tout le monde. J'ai appris beaucoup de choses et je suis sûr que c'est le cas pour vous aussi. Dit-il. -Lequel avez vous préféré, Monsieur Adler? Un garçon lui demanda. -Aucun. J'ai aimé toutes les leçons de manière égale. Répondit-il, préférant rester neutre. Et maintenant que nous nous sommes bien amusés, il est temps d'apprendre à additionner des nombres! Leur dit-il de manière taquine, en répétant les mots de son élève. Les enfants laissèrent échapper un grognement collectif mais il était content de voir qu'ils étaient tous de meilleure humeur .

Deux chevaliers étaient dans le champ de bataille , avec seulement la lumière aveuglante du soleil comme leur témoin . Les deux se tenaient en position de combat et s'encerclaient. Peu de temps s'écoula avant que l'un d'eux n'attaqua l'autre avec un cri de guerre . Il se lança sur son adversaire qui bloqua son épée avec la sienne. Claque ! Seuls les bruits de fer battant le fer pouvaient s'entendre tandis que les deux s’affrontèrent. Ils firent beaucoup d'efforts pour coordonner leurs mouvements, levant leurs armes pour attaquer et basculant leurs corps pour esquiver les coups de l'autre. Ce n'était que lorsque l'un d'eux exécuta un mouvement assez fort pour désarmer son adversaire que la bataille se termina. Le vainqueur se tint avec son épée pointée vers son ennemi qui avait levé les mains en l'air en signe de soumission puis baissa son arme . Les deux chevaliers enlevèrent leurs casques et se serrèrent la main avec un sourire . -C'était un bel effort, le gagnant dit. -Mais tu dois t’entraîner davantage. Le perdant lui tira la langue et lui dit qu'il le savait déjà. -Grand frère ! Un petit garçon courra soudainement vers le chevalier vainqueur . -Tu as encore gagné ! Tu es le meilleur ! Son grand frère lui ébouriffa les cheveux avant de le prendre dans ses bras puis le mit sur ses épaules. -Oui, Edward et tu vas être comme moi quand tu seras plus grand, d'ailleurs, tu seras encore meilleur que moi ! Les deux allèrent à l’intérieur du château pour voir s’ils pourraient avoir quelque chose à grignoter avant le déjeuner et en faisant leur chemin vers la cuisine, ils entendirent les hauts cris de la cuisinière . -Qui était-ce ? Lequel d'entre vous a osé voler l’agneau ? Elle hurla sur trois gardes et deux femmes de chambre. Aucun d'eux ne répondit et ils échangèrent des expressions inquiètes entre eux. Le chevalier et son petit frère entrèrent dans la cuisine et quand la cuisinière les vit, son visage s'éclaira. -Ah ! Sire Maximilian ! Je suis heureuse de vous voir. Veuillez dire à ces mécréants d'admettre lequel d'eux a volé mon gigot d’agneau.Il était censé être servi sur la table du roi pour le dîner de ce soir ! Dit-elle en jetant un regard plein de réprimande sur les femmes de chambre et les gardes qui étaient là-bas. -Vous... avez perdu un gigot d’agneau ? Maximilian demanda en arquant un sourcil. -Mais bien sûr que non ! Qui pourrait bien perdre un objet aussi large ? Je ne l'ai pas perdu. Il a été volé, évidement ! La cuisinière répondit en roulant les yeux au plafond. Maximilian hocha la tête et s'excusa de l'avoir mal compris. -Quand l'avez-vous vu la dernière fois ? Demanda-t-il. -Il était sous la table, entrain de mariner tranquillement dans une grande marmite avec des herbes et des épices. Je l'ai couvert avec ce torchon . Elle lui montra un grand morceau de tissu . Et quand je suis retournée à la cuisine, il n'était plus là ! La marmite était vide et seul le torchon était sur la table. Lui dit-elle avec un soupir misérable. -J'ai mis un autre gigot dans la marmite pour le dîner de ce soir et donc sa majesté le roi ne va pas en souffrir, mais le coupable doit être capturé ! -En effet. Le jeune homme dit en hochant la tête. -Si vous permettez, Sire Maximilian... ? L'une des femmes de chambre dit. -Allez-y, je vous en prie. -Je me suis rendu à la cuisine il y a une heure. J'ai vu la marmite vide et j'ai cru que c'était étonnant mais je ne l'ai pas touché. Le torchon était par terre et donc je l'ai ramassé et plié avant de le mettre sur la table, puis j'ai nettoyé le sol avant d'aller dans le jardin . Je ne suis retourné que maintenant pour trouver la cuisinière entrain de crier à propos le gigot perdu. Celui ou celle qui l'a pris l'a sûrement fait avant que je ne sois rentrée dans la cuisine. La jeune femme de chambre dit. Maximilian hocha la tête en signe de compréhension avant de retourner son attention aux auteurs. -Est-ce que l'un de vous s'était rendu à la cuisine avant cela ? L'autre femme de chambre et les gardes dirent non et il trouva le fait que seulement ceux qui étaient dans la pièce travaillaient dans la cuisine. Le jeune frère de Maximilian prit la parole. -Est-ce que le sol de la cuisine était sale quand vous avez mariné le gigot d'agneau ce matin ? Le petit garçon demanda à la cuisinière avec curiosité . -Non. La cuisine est toujours nettoyée la nuit et quand je suis venue préparer l'agneau, il n'y avait même pas un grain de poussière sur le sol. La cuisinière répondit. Edward demanda en plus a la femme de chambre qui avait parlé auparavant pourquoi elle avait nettoyé le sol. -Parce qu'il y avait une traînée de graisses sur le sol menant à la porte arrière. Il y avait aussi de la terre sur la traînée. Dit-elle. Le petit garçon regarda son frère et dit que cela devait signifier que celui ou celle qui avait pris l'agneau devait l'avoir traîné au jardin et cela expliquerait la traînée de graisse et ce que la femme de chambre pensait être de la terre devait être les épices et les herbes . -Oui, c'est logique. As-tu vu l'un des enfants traîner quelque chose hors de la cuisine ? Son grand-frère demanda. Seul un enfant aurait besoin de traîner un gigot d'agneau puisqu'un adulte serait assez fort pour le porter. -Non, mais je crois que je sais qui est le voleur . Le petit garçon prit ensuite la main de son frère et le tira hors de la cuisine et dans le jardin jusqu’à ce qu'ils arrivèrent à la niche du chien du prince. Quand Maximilian s’agenouilla par terre et regarda à l'intérieur, il trouva le chien endormi, blottit autour du gigot perdu qui était à présent à moitié consommé. La cuisinière, les femmes de chambre et les gardes suivirent le jeune chevalier qui se tourna vers eux avec un sourire. -Je crois que ça résout notre devinette . Puis, il se tourna vers la cuisinière et mit un bras autour des épaules d'Edward. -Je crois qu'il a mérité une gâterie pour avoir résolu le mystère , pas vrai ? La cuisinière claqua sa langue, lamentant le gigot gâché et hocha sa tête. -Venez à la cuisine , j'ai quelques tartelettes aux fraises de ce matin qui sont encore fraîches.

Aujourd'hui , c'était la journée des idiomes! Chaque année à l'école d'Emma, une journée était dédiée pour un jeu élaboré que les enfants jouaient où ils préparaient des costumes, un dessin , un poème ou quoi que ce soit pour indiquer et donner des indices sur un idiome particulier et leurs camarades devaient le deviner et donner sa signification. Les enseignants pensaient que c'était une façon merveilleuse d'apprendre aux enfants des idiomes populaires et leur signification et les élèves aimaient le jeu amusant, surtout car il pouvaient choisir l’idiome qu'ils utiliseraient avec l'aide de leurs parents. Plus l’idiome était ridicule, mieux c'était et ils firent de leur mieux chaque année pour rendre le jeux aussi amusant que possible. Emma s'assied à sa place et les enfants se calmèrent et prêtèrent attention au premier idiome. L'un de leur camarades portait un costume de chien et quand l'enseignant leur dit qu'ils pouvaient commencer à deviner , les enfants commencèrent à dire ce qu'ils croyaient être l'idiome représenté. -Chien en vie en vaut mieux que lion mort. L'un des garçons dit à haute voix. Le garçon qui portait le costume fronça ses sourcils et secoua sa tête, indiquant que ce n'était pas ça. -Chien hargneux à toujours oreille déchirée. Un autre s'écria. Mais, sa réponse n’était pas correcte. -Qui m'aime, aime mon chien? Emma dit avec hésitation. C'était le seul idiome de chien qu'elle connaissait en plus de ceux qui avaient été mentionnés par les autres. -Non. Désolé. Le garçon dit. Voici un indice. Il commença ensuite à aboyer . -Les chien aboient et la caravane passe! Un garçon cria avec enthousiasme. -Oui! C'est la bonne réponse. Le garçon qui représentait l'idiome avait dit avant de commencer à expliquer que celui-ci signifie que ce que disent ou pensent les autres ne nous empêche pas d'accomplir ce qu'on veut. L'élève suivante était une fille qui avait décidé de faire deviner son idiome petit à petit à travers une charade qu'elle allait mimer. Elle commença par lever un petit doigt. -Le premier mot! Emma dit et la fille hocha la tête avant de commencer à mimer la signification du premier mot. Elle toucha son poignet , la tapotant avec l'index de l'autre main. -Une main? Le garçon assis à coté d'Emma devina. Elle secoua son doigt, indiquant que ce n'était pas ça avant de se retourner et de pointer un doigt à l'horloge qui était suspendu sur le mur de la classe, au dessus du tableau. -L'horloge! Une autre enfant dit et quand elle inclina la tête pour lui indiquer qu'elle était proche , une autre dit. -Le temps. Ce qui était la bonne réponse. Ensuite elle agita sa main pour dessiner un demi cercle en l'air. -Un cerceau? Un ballon? Une fenêtre? La lettre "C"? Elle continua à secouer la tête jusqu'à la dernière suggestion et indiqua que c'était ça. Puis, la fille leva trois doigts pour indiquer qu'elle allait mimer le dernier mot qui allait les aider à deviner. Elle leva la main et frotta son pouce contre son indexe et son majeur. -Pincer ? Cette réponse était fausse et elle secoua la tête. -Monnaie? Elle hocha la tête et fit un geste de la main pour leur indiquer de lui donner des synonymes du mot. -Pièces? -Billets? -Argent ! La fille pointa du doigt le garçon qui avait deviné le mot "Argent" et commença à sauter pour indiquer aux autres garçon que sa réponse était la bonne . Puis Elle leva successivement son index suivit de son majeur et son annulaire, indiquant aux autres de se rappeler des trois mots. -Temps, C, Argent...?Le temps c'est de l'argent! Emma s'écria. Sa mère utilisait toujours cet idiome pour inciter ses enfants à commencer à faire leurs devoirs , elle n'arrivait pas à croire qu'elle n'y avait pas penser plus tôt. -Oui! C'est exacte! Le temps c'est de l'argent est un idiome traduit de l'Anglais qui signifie que bien employer son temps engendre un profit. Elle expliqua avec un grand sourire avant de retourner s'asseoir à sa place. Emma pensa que ce idiome était son préféré et pas parce qu'elle avait réussi à le deviner correctement mais à cause des efforts de la fille pour leur faire deviner l'idiome de manière amusante . L'élève suivant qui était monté au tableau dessina un triangle avec une fraise au dessus. -Celui-ci est trop facile! Dit l'un de ses camarades. -On pourrait même dire que c'est du gâteau ! Un de ses amis compléta. Les deux garçons qui avaient dit ceci se tapèrent la main avec un sourire complice. Et après leurs mots, il n'y avait aucun besoin d’expliquer l'expression et Emma pensa qu'en effet, c'était quelque chose de facile à deviner bien qu'elle doutait du fait que l'expression "Du gâteau" pouvait être considérée être un idiome. Maintenant, elle devait passer au tableau à son tour . Elle prit un souffle avant de monter et elle se contenta de mettre un serre-tête avec des oreilles de chat, tout simplement, pour représenter son idiome. Son déguisement n'était rien de sophistiqué mais mais elle pensait que l'idiome qu'elle avait choisi était un peu difficile à deviner et elle était très excitée. -Avoir un chat dans la gorge? Dit un garçon qui s'asseyait d'habitude derrière elle et elle secoua sa tête, ce n'était pas ça. -Appeler un chat un chat?L'une des filles dit en inclinant sa tête sur le coté. -Non, dit-elle en baillant . Elle ne voulait pas donner plus d'indices que ça, sinon ça serait trop clair. -La nuit, tout les chats sont gris. -Incorrecte. Dit-elle en faisant semblant de s'endormir . Elle ne savait même pas ce que la dernière suggestion d’idiome signifiait. -Oh! N'éveillez pas le chat qui dort ! L'un des garçon devina enfin et elle hocha la tête. -On dit "Ne réveillez pas le chat qui dort." Pour dire de ne pas invoquer des histoires anciennes qui pourraient causer des problèmes. Dit-elle en enlevant son serre-tête avant de reprendre sa place. Elle s'était bien amusée. Elle était un peut stressée au début mais après, ça avait passé. l'idiome suivant était présenté par deux garçons qui se tenaient la main et qui regardaient droit devant eux. Ils semblaient marcher avec maladresse ou du moins, ils prétendaient marcher maladroitement. -Voici un indice: On ne peut rien voir . Dit l'un des deux garçon et attendit que ses camarades devinent l'idiome en question. -Au royaume des aveugles , les borgnes sont rois? -Non. Essai encore une fois. -Avoir des yeux pour ne rien voir? Emma dit en faisant un petite grimace. Bien qu'elle savait que l'idiome voulait dire faire comme si de rien n'était, elle le trouva bizarre . Les deux garçons rigolèrent. -Elle est bonne, celle-là! Mais, non. -Un aveugle sans bâton ? Un garçon suggéra avec un sourire. -Oh, pas mal! Mais ce n'est pas ça non plus. L'un des garçons lui dit. -Un aveugle qui en conduit un autre! Lily, La meilleure amie d'Emma devina. -Oui! Les garçons l'applaudirent. Dire de quelqu'un que c'est un aveugle qui en conduit un autre signifie que cette personne est aussi impudente où ignorante que celle qu'elle dirige. Les garçons sourirent à leurs camarades avant de retourner s'asseoir. Les enfants continuèrent ainsi jusqu'à ce qu'il était temps pour eux de rentrer chez eux. Leur enseignant les remercia et leur dit qu'il était fier d'eux et les informa qu'il allait y avoir un vote le jour suivant pour l'idiome le plus amusant . Emma ne pensait pas qu'elle allait gagner mais ce n'était pas important car elle s'était beaucoup amusé!

Toby était très excité d'accompagner son père dehors. Les deux allaient au marché pour acheter des légumes puis au super marché pour faire les courses. Malgré que ces tâches n'avaient rien d'excitant, le petit garçon était heureux . C'était la première fois où il sortait pour faire ce genre de shopping, d'habitude il sortait avec ses parents pour acheter des vêtements ou des jouets mais jamais pour acheter de la nourriture. Il se demanda si son père lui permettrait d'acheter beaucoup de gâteries... Une fois qu'ils arrivèrent au marché, le petit garçon sauta pratiquement hors de la voiture avant que son père ne put quitter son siège . Toby courra en avant et en se rappelant de son père, il s’arrêta brusquement. Il se retourna et regarda son père fermer la voiture avant de se tourner pour le regarder. -Ne court pas mon grand. Tu risque de tomber et de te faire mal! Son père marcha vers lui et prit sa main. Et ensuite on va se faire gronder. Il fit un clin d’œil à son fils avec un sourire. Toby rigola joyeusement. Le prospect de se faire gronder avec son père le rendit heureux et il pensa que cela le rendrait plus proche de son père. Comme des camarades qui auraient désobéi aux ordres et qui se feraient réprimander par leur supérieur. Mais, sa mère était plus belle qu'un supérieur en armé, bien évidement! Le petit garçon était plein d'enthousiasme en voyant les tables pleines de fruits et légumes colorés. Des tomates rouges vif, des cerises et des poivrons. Des pommes vertes, des brocolis , des asperges. Des oranges, des citrouilles , des aubergines, des myrtilles, des pommes de terre et des melons. Il y avait tous les légumes qu'il connaissait et même certains qu'il ne connaissait pas. Certaines parties du marché était même dédiées aux poissons, épices , haricots et herbes. Lui et son père firent leur chemin à travers cet endroit en achetant ce qui était marqué dans leur liste de courses puis retournèrent à la voiture et mirent leurs sacs de légumes dans la malle. Le super marché était beaucoup moins excitant. Les produits était simplement présentés sur des étagères dans de différentes allées. Il y n'y avait pas de tables avec des vendeurs qui bavardaient et riaient avec les clients mais il y avaient quelques employés qui offraient des échantillons de dégustation de tartelettes et de sauces au fromages et d’autres produits du genre. Toby était content d'y être cependant, car son père lui avait permis de choisir la marque céréales et lui avait même acheter une barre de chocolat comme récompense pour être resté sage. Quand ils retournèrent à la maison, ils passèrent par une vente de garage que leur voisin tenait et encore une fois, Toby était intrigué par les gens qui s'étaient rassemblés autour des tables sur lesquelles de différents objets étaient présentés. Quand son père expliqua qu'une vente de garage était un moyen pour se faire un peu d'argent et se débarrasser des objets dont on n'a plus besoin, le petit garçon eut une idée. L'après-midi, quand Toby rencontra ses amis dehors, il leur parla de son idée . -On devrait tenir un marché. On peut vendre des gâteries que nos mamans prépareraient ou des objets que l'on n'utilise plus. -Quels types d'objets? Un de ses amis lui demanda. -Des jouets. Des livres de coloriage. N'importe quel objet que tu n'utilise plus. Il expliqua. -Qui les achèterait? Je ne crois pas que les adultes voudront des jouets et les enfants n'ont pas beaucoup d'argent. Certains n'ontmême pas d'argent de poche. Une autre amie lui dit. -On peut simplement faire des échanges . Si l'un de vous aime quelque chose que l'autre vend, il peut échanger avec lui un autre objet. Toby dit ayant déjà pensé au manque d'argent. -Les adultes n’achèteront peut être pas de jouets mais il achèteront des biscuits et du jus. Mon grand frère vendait de la limonade l'été dernier et il s'est fait assez d'argent pour acheter un nouveau téléphone . -Je pense que c'est une bonne idée. J'ai toujours voulu avoir un magasin de bouquins quand je serais grand et maintenant je peux commencer à m’entraîner. Un autre enfant dit. Les autres enfants bavardèrent avec enthousiasme et ils étaient tous excités par leur petit projet. -On doit demander la permission des adultes, par contre. Toby dit. Et pas que nos parents, on doit voir si les voisins n'auront pas d’inconvénients. -Qu'est-ce qu'on va faire avec l'argent? On lui demanda par la suite. Toby n'y avait pas pensé. Il était vrai qu'ils n'avaient besoin de rien puisque leurs parents prenaient soin de leur acheter tout ce dont ils avaient besoin et il pensa que leurs parents n’approuveraient pas qu'ils utilisent l'argent pour s'acheter des bonbons ou des jeux. Il savait que les adultes leur disaient toujours de ne pas gaspiller l'argent. -On pourrait en faire un don aux enfants malades dans les hôpitaux. L'un des garçons dit en haussant les épaules. N'est-ce pas ce que les scouts font quand ils vendent leurs biscuits? Ils font des dons et ils utilisent l'argent pour leurs programmes d'école, pas vrai? Les enfants se mirent tous d'accord sur ce point et il pensèrent tous que ça allait les aider pour convaincre leurs parents et le reste du quartier. Les enfants se mirent d'accord et demandèrent la permission à leurs parents quand ils rentrèrent chez eux. Le jour suivant, ils se divisèrent et rendirent visite à leurs voisins pour demander leur permission pour établir leur petit marché de quartier et personne ne protesta. Certains offrirent même de préparer des gâteries pour qu'ils les vendent. -Mme. Jordan fait le meilleur pain au bananes! Ça va se vendre en un rien de temps. Toby dit avec un grand sourire. Les enfants rassemblèrent les objets dont ils n'avaient plus besoin: Des livres d'histoires, les livres de coloriage, des jouets, des affaires scolaires et même des vêtements. Certains avaient demander à leurs parents de leur faire des gâteaux et certains préparèrent du jus tandis que d'autres préparèrent simplement des sandwiches et les voisins comme Mme. Jordan participèrent également en préparant de la nourriture ou en leur donnant des tables et des parasols pour le marché. Le marché n'était pas trop large, juste trois tables qui avaient été installées dans l'aire de jeux du quartier et les enfants en étaient en charge. Toby échangea sa voiture téléguidée contre un beau T-shirt et l'une des filles acheta ses feutres en couleur. Les enfants qui vendaient de la nourriture offrirent des échantillons de dégustations et les adultes achetèrent du jus et des gâteaux pour eux et leurs enfants et tout le monde s'amusa. À la fin de la journée, l'argent qui avait été gagné fut compté et mit dans une grande enveloppe qui avait les noms de tous les enfants qui avaient organisé la vente écris sur elle et ils l’envoyèrent au programme de charité pour enfants de l’hôpital.

Carter regardait avec grande fascination une image qui l'avait toujours intéressé dans son livre d'histoire. C'était une illustration colorée d'une tortue qui portait une île sur sa carapace et qui nageait dans l’océan. L'histoire était sur l'amitié que la tortue avait formée avec les humains qui vivaient sur l'île qu'elle portait pendant des générations mais ce qui captura l'attention du petit garçon était le concept d'une île mouvante. -Je me demande ce que ça ferait de vivre là-bas... pensa-t-il. Son esprit voyagea dans un bateau ou le capitaine était son imagination et il commença à rêvasser sur comment ça serait d'être l'un des habitants de l'île tortue. La première chose qui croisa son esprit était l'effet du mouvement de l'île sur ses habitants. -Je me demande si on peut avoir le mal de mer ici... dit-il en marchant à travers le village. Tout le monde parut en bon état et il ne sentit pas de nausée ou de vertige lui-même et il en conclut que non, les gens n'avaient pas le mal de mer sur l'île tortue. En explorant un peu partout, il vit de différents arbres et plantes. Il était confus pour un moment avant qu'il n'entendit une petite fille dire à son père qu'elle n'arrivait pas à attendre jusqu'à ce que le bananier portera ses fruits. -Soit patiente, quand l'île est sur la bonne position, ça arrivera. Son père lui avait répondu avec un sourire. Carter se rappela soudainement de ce qu'il avait appris à l'école et pensa que c'était génial que l'île puisse avoir tant de variété grâce aux climats des régions par lesquelles elle passait. -Je pari qu'il y a aussi de différents types de poissons dans le marché à travers l'année. Se dit-il à haute voix. -C'est correct ! Une fille lui dit avec un fier sourire. Pas que ça, on ramène aussi de différents types de viande et de pattes des pays par lesquels on passe. -C'est super ! Carter dit avant d'étendre sa main pour serrer la sienne. -Je suis Carter. Se présenta-t-il. -Elena. Ravie de faire ta connaissance, Carter. -Moi aussi ! -Tu veux aller voir la galerie des souvenirs ? Elena offrit. -C'est quoi ? -C'est un endroit où de différents objets que l'on a acheté de différents pays sont gardés. Généralement des objets provenant de pays côtiers puisque l'île ne peut pas s’arrêter assez longtemps pour nous permettre de visiter les autres pays des continents. Elena expliqua avec un sourire. -Ça paraît génial. Après toi ! Carter dit, excité à l'idée de voir ce qu'il y avait dans la galerie. Le premier objet qu'Elena lui montra était une statue en céramique d'un chat qui avait une patte levée. -Ceci s'appelle Maneki-neko. Le chat de chance japonais ! Lui dit- elle. On l'a clairement ramené du Japon. Les gens là-bas pensent qu'il apporte de la chance à son propriétaire. -Cool ! Carter dit en regardant le chat. Il était aussi très mignon . Elena l’emmena ensuite à une table où un service à thé en céramique était posé. Il y avait une théière et des tasses de couleur blanche avec des motifs en bleu. Carter pensa que le service avait l'air très élégant et il imagina qu’un roi l'utiliserait pour boire son thé. -Ceci vient de la Russie. Ça s'appelle Gzhel et ça prend son nom du village Russe où c’est fabriqué. Elena lui dit. Carter prit un moment pour admirer les dessins élaborés des motifs qui étaient peints sur la théière avant de passer à l'article suivant. C'était un objet très curieux. Ça semblait être un plat profond en argile avec un couvercle en forme de cône. C'était d'une belle couleur moutarde avec des motifs marrons, rouges et noirs peints dessus. -Qu'est-ce que c’est ? Demanda-t-il curieusement. -Ceci est un plat Tajine. Ça vient du Maroc et c'est utilisé pour cuisiner des Tajines qui sont des plats riches à base de légumes et de viande d'agneau avec une délicieuse sauce. Elena se lécha les livres en se rappelant du Tajine qu'elle avait mangé quand l'île était passée par le Maroc. Quand ils avancèrent à travers la galerie, Elena montra à Carter un magnifique vase provenant de la Grèce avec une scène de la mythologie grecque peinte dessus. Elle lui montera aussi des objets en céramique provenant de l'Italie, de l'Espagne, du Brésil, de la Chine, et de divers autres pays. -Ils sont tous très beaux, mais est-ce qu'il y a seulement des pots et des vases dans la galerie ? Demanda-t-il curieusement. Elena rigola. -Bien sûr que non, petit genie ! Cette partie est dédiée aux céramiques. La galerie est immense ! Lui dit-elle, en jetant ses bras en l'air pour indiquer à quel point l'endroit était vaste. -Viens, allons voir la partie des habilles ! Et sur ce, elle le mena à une autre section à travers une porte. L'endroit était drapé de robes et de tenues de différentes couleurs et Carter lâcha un petit sifflement d’émerveillement. Il regarda l'habit soyeux qui était suspendu sur le mur à sa droite. C'était magnifique avec des couleurs pales et de très jolis motifs. -C'est un Yukata. Magnifique, n'est-ce pas ? Elena dit avec un regard rêveur. J'en ai un chez moi qui m'a été offert par une fille que j'ai rencontrée au Japon. Mais, pas aussi joli que celui-là. Ça reste très beau, par contre ! -Est-ce que celui-ci est pour hommes ? Demanda-t-il en indiquant une version beaucoup plus simple de couleurs bleu nuit et gris foncé. Elena hocha la tête et le mena en avant pour voir des vêtements provenant d'autres pays : des Saris venant d'Inde, des Kilts venant d’Écosse, des Agbada du Nigéria et beaucoup d'autres. Carter était très impressionné par tout ce qu'il avait vu et pas seulement à cause de la beauté des articles qui étaient dans la galerie mais aussi par les cultures que chaque objet reflétait. L'île tortue était bien plus qu'un endroit où les fruits et les poissons provenant de différentes régions du monde se trouvaient, c’était aussi un bateau géant permettant à tous ceux qui y étaient de voyager à travers le monde, de rencontrer des gens de nationalités différentes et d'apprendre leurs cultures et même leurs langues. Quand son père frappa à sa porte pour lui demander ce qu’il était en train de faire, Carter sortit de son île imaginaire. -Pas grand-chose. Il répondit. Papa ? Dit-il par la suite. -Oui ? Son père entra dans sa chambre. -Est-ce que tu penses qu'il serait facile d'écrire un livre d'histoire illustré ? Carter demanda. Il avait une très bonne idée.

(French Language) (Reading Comprehension) D G (With Answer)

Jennie, Marshall et Ophelia se rassemblèrent au centre de la maison. Chaque fin de semaine , ils incitèrent leur mère à sortir avec ses amies et à se détendre pendant qu'ils nettoyèrent la maison avec l'aide de leur père et sous sa surveillance. -Alors voilà, puisqu'on est à court de certaines choses, Papa est sorti acheter ce dont on a besoin mais on peut quand même diviser les tâches maintenant. Ophelia, l’aînée , dit sur un ton enfantin mais ferme. Son frère et sa sœur hochèrent la tête en accord et attendirent qu'elle délégua leur tâches. -Comme d'habitude, Papa va s'occuper des cuvettes, fenêtres et miroirs. Elle commença. Jennie, tu avait fait la vaisselle la semaine passé, donc Marshall va faire cela cette semaine. Dit-elle à sa sœur. Tu vas passer l'aspirateur au salon et au couloir tandis que je m'occupe du linge et je vais aussi faire le parterre de la cuisine . Est-ce que tout le monde à compris? Encore une fois, les enfants les plus jeunes hochèrent leurs têtes. À peine un moment plus tard, leur père ouvrit la porte et ils se dirigèrent tous vers la cuisine pour leurs nouveaux produits de nettoyage. Marshall prit une paire de gants et une bouteille de savon vaisselle. -Est-ce que je peux aussi remplacer la vieille éponge? Elle est devenue dégueulasse. Il demanda à son père qui hocha la tête. -Je vais aussi changer la brosse des toilettes. Il est bien de changer les outils fréquemment, plus ils deviennent usés plus ils contiennent de bactéries. Son père dit en prenant deux flacons vaporisateurs, une brosse, une paire de gants et un masque qui le protégerait des produits chimiques qui étaient dans les produits de nettoyage. Jennie qui était chargée de passer l'aspirateur prit également un des masques pour se protéger de la poussière . Et quand tout le monde avait ce dont ils avaient besoin, ils se tapèrent les mains et se mirent au travail. -Allez, les enfants. Montrons à Maman comment le nettoyage professionnel se fait! Leur père dit. Le seul qui resta dans la cuisine était Marshall vu qu'il était celui qui allait faire la vaisselle. La première chose qu'il fit était de porter le tablier à froufrous de sa mère vu que celui de son père était trop grand pour lui. Il tourna et rigola et voyant le tablier se bouffer autour de lui. Puis, il glissa ses mains dans les gants en caoutchouc et remplit la cuvettes d'eau avant d'ajouter le savon vaisselle. Il agita ses mains dans l'eau jusqu'à ce qu'elle devint mousseuse et pleine de bulles et il s'amusa à faire de petites formes avec la mousse et a souffler sur les bulles . Il commença à chantonner le générique de son dessin animé préféré et se mit à frotter les plats sales, s'assurant que chaque tâche était partie. Ce serait dommage si sa mère aurait à les laver une deuxième fois s’il ne fit pas son travail proprement. De l'autre coté du mur qui séparait la cuisine du salon, Jennie avait commencé par faire un peu d'ordre. Elle aimait prétendre qu'elle était en mission urgente et donc, elle régla un minuteur sur le téléphone de son père et hocha sa tête avant de commencer. Elle ramassa les objets qui étaient sur son chemin comme la couverture qui était sur le fauteuil et la bouteille d'eau qui était sur la table basse et les mit à part avant d'essuyer la poussière qui était sur les meubles. -La voie est libre! Annonça-t-elle au salon vide. Initialisation de la partie deux de la mission. Dit-elle après avoir déterminer que rien ne serait sur son chemin. Puis, elle mit l'aspirateur en marche et commença par le tapis. À chaque fois qu'elle finit de nettoyer une partie du salon, elle dit: "La voie est sûr!" Dans la salle de bain , Ophelia tria le linge sale et sépara les vêtement colorés des blancs. Elle aimait empiler les vêtements coloré dans l'ordre de leur apparition dans l'arc en ciel et elle empila les vêtements blancs en commençant par ceux les moins pures à ceux qui étaient aussi blancs que de la neige. Elle remplit le bouchon de détergent et le mit dans le compartiment correspondant de la machine à laver après s'être assurée qu'elle avait bien mesuré, cela lui donna l'impression d'être une chimiste, et elle commença à mettre les vêtements dans la machine. Elle appuya sur quelques boutons et le cycle de lavage se lança. Le père de famille allait de chambre en chambre, nettoyant les fenêtres et les miroirs. La chambre de Marshall n'avait que le miroir qui était monté sur son armoire et une seule fenêtre et donc il commença par elle vu qu'elle était la plus facile à nettoyer. Et si quelqu'un lui aurait demandé quelle pièce était la plus difficile , il aurait dit que c'était le salon avec ses fenêtres qui allaient du sol au plafond. Il était impatient de voir ses enfants grandir pour qu'ils puissent l'aider à les nettoyer. Pour l'instant, c'était lui et sa femme qui s'en occupaient vu que c'était trop dangereux pour les enfants de monter sur des chaises pour arriver aux parties les plus hautes et il se pourrait que l'un d'eux perd son équilibre et tombe . Quand les vêtements avaient fini leur cycle de lavage, et firent un tour dans le sèche linge, Marshall avait finit de faire la vaisselle et les membres de la famille firent une rotation dans les chambres. Papa alla à la salle de bain pour nettoyer les cuvettes, Ophelia alla à la cuisine pour faire le parterre et Marshall alla dans sa chambre pour organiser son bureau et ranger ses jouets . Jennie, d’autre part, était entrain de passer l'aspirateur dans la chambre de ses parents. Tous les enfants avaient trouvé un moyen de s'amuser en faisant leurs tâches et l'idée de rendre leur mère fière et heureuse les poussa à travailler dur. Quand tout le monde avait fini ses corvées, leur père les emmena déjeuner dehors. -C'est plus juste ainsi. Nous aussi on a le droit de manger dans un restaurant élégant, n'est-ce pas? Il leur dit en rigolant. Ils savourèrent tous leur plats et retournèrent chez eux. Comme chaque week-end, leur mère exprima sa joie et son appréciation de leur travail et leur considération avant de leur donner des cadeaux qu'elle leur avait ramené de sa sortie. Certains étaient des pâtisseries, d'autres étaient des breloques mais tout le monde était d'accord que le meilleur cadeau était l'expression de fierté dans les yeux de leur mère quand elle vit la maison briller de propreté.

German (Exercise) D G (With Answer)

Practice choosing the correct gender and saying der, die, or das with each of the words that follows. For example, when presented with the word Vater, you would say der Vater because Vater (father) is masculine. Write the correct article on the line.

1. Mantel (coat) _____________________  
2. Ausstellung (exhibition) _____________________  
3. Gelächter (laughter) _____________________  
4. Klasse (class) _____________________  
5. Brunnen (well, source of water) _____________________  
6. Sprache (language) _____________________  
7. Männchen (little man) _____________________  
8. Prüfung (exam) _____________________

1. der Mantel  
2. die Ausstellung  
3. das Gelächter

German (Change the article) D G (With Answer)

Change the definite article of each noun to the indefinite article. For example, when presented with the word der Vater, you would say ein Vater to change to the indefinite article.

1. der Lehrer (teacher) _____________________  
2. die Schauspielerin (actress) _____________________  
3. die Tasse (cup) _____________________  
4. der Pilot (pilot) _____________________  
5. das Mädchen (girl) _____________________  

Now change the indefinite article of each noun to the definite article. For example, when presented with ein Vater, you would say der Vater to change it to the definite article. (Watch out! This one is trickier. Since masculine and neuter words both take the indefinite article ein, you’ll have to recall the rules for determining gender in these cases.)
