•  Input devices  send signals to the processor. 
Examples of input 

devices are the mouse and keyboard. 

•  Output devices  get signals from the processor. 

Examples of output devices are the screen and speaker. 

The input and output devices let you use the computer. 

Desktop computer 

In a desktop computer all the devices are quite big. 
For 
example, the screen is big. There might be more 
than one screen. 

The devices are separate from each other. They might be 
joined by wires. 
They might be wireless. 

A desktop computer is big and heavy. It is difficult to carry. 
Laptop computer 

A laptop computer has smaller parts. The screen and the 
keyboard are small. All the parts are held in the same 
case. 
They are fixed in place. 

A laptop is small and light. It is easy to carry. 

The touch pad is used instead of a mouse. Some people 
take a mouse with them and plug it into the laptop.

A  program  is a set of commands. The commands control 
the computer. 

In this unit you will make a program with 
Scratch. In Scratch, the commands ore 
blocks. You 
fit the blocks together. That 
makes the program. 

Programmer and user 

The person who makes a program is called a 

programmer.  The programmer chooses the 
commands and puts them in order. 

Anyone can  run  the program. Running a program 
means the computer carries out the commands in 
the program. The person who runs the program is 
called a  user. 

The programmer and user can be different people. 
In this unit, you will be the programmer and the 
user. 
You will make a program. Then you will use

A program is a set of stored commands. The stored commands will 
carry out the same tasks in the same order each time you run the 
program. We  say  the values are  fixed.  The numbers do not change. 

Variable values 

To change program values, you can get input from 
the user. 
The new values will make the program do 
a different thing. In this lesson you will change the 
number of steps. 

• If  the number of steps is big, the star will be big. 

• If  the number of steps is small, the star will be small. 

The number of steps is a  variable  value. The number 
can change. 

Get input 

Do you remember the 'ask' block? It is one of the light 
blue 'Sensing' blocks. 

What's your name? 

Drag the 'ask' block into the script area. Change the 
e 
words in the block so that it says "How many steps?" 

Computer Science T D 3 M
You will get input once, before the loop starts. So put 
the 'ask' block into the program, just above the 
'forever' loop. 

You will hove to pull the blocks apart, fit in the new 
block, and then join the whole thing together again. 

Remember, 
the 'answer' block represents the input 
from the user. 
Find the 'answer' block and fix it into the 
program.  It  goes inside the'move ... steps' block. 

Result! 

When you run the program, the sprite asks 
"How many 

steps?" 
A small number will make a small star, and a big 
number will make a big star. 

A student gave the number 300. 
The star looked this big. 

Computer Science T D 3 M
In this program the pen size is set to 5. Make 
changes to the program so that: 

• The sprite asks 
"What pen size?" 

Computer Science T D 3 M
Load the program you made in the last lesson. Now you will change 
the program so that the user inputs the number of degrees. 

Here are the changes you must make: 

• Change the question "How many steps?"to "How 

many degrees?" 

• Move the 'answer' block out of the 'move ... steps' block. Th 
is goes 

back to 100 steps. 
e 
• 
Move the 'answer' block into the 'turn ... degrees' black. 

Computer Science T D 3 M
Find the block that changes the pen colour. Enter the number 1 in this 
block. This gives a colourful effect as the sprite draws the shape. 

Computer Science T D 3 M
Make a program that asks 
"How many degrees?" 
and uses 
the answer 
in the 'turn' block. 

You can make other changes to the numbers in the program blocks. 

This picture was made using these values: 

• pen size 1 

• change pen colour by  1 

• move 300 steps. 

The user answered the question "How many degrees?" 
with the number 145. 

Try these values and any others that you have time for.

"How many degrees?"Without that block the computer 
does not have an input value. 

Make this program with the mistake in it. Run the 
program. What happens? Can you fix this program to 
remove the error? 
Fixed values 

Many command blocks have fixed values in them. 
If  the values are wrong, then the program will not 
work properly. 

Computer Science T D 3 M
shape it draws is too small. Can you think of a number that is 
too big? 

Try it out. 

Loop errors 

Commands inside the loop are repeated many 
times. Commands before the loop happen only 
once. Some blocks belong inside the loop. Some 
belong outside. 

Here is a program with an error in it. Can you see 
what the error is? 

The 'ask' block is inside the loop. That means the 
program will ask for the number of degrees over 
and over again. That's not what the program is 

supposed to do!

'

◄ 
In your activity you looked at a program with an error. 
Write down the commands in that program. Write a 
note to say what the error is and how you fixed it. 

Computer Science T D 3 M
When you make a program, you start by thinking of the output you 
expect to see. 
This is 
the program  requirement. 

A programmer was asked to make a program. This was the 
requirement. 

Draw an endless rainbow line on the screen using a 'forever' loop. 

Here is the program they made. The program has errors in it. 

You will learn about different ways to find and fix errors. 

Look and find 

One way to find errors is 
just to look at the program. You 
might spot straight away that there is a problem. 

In this program the 'erase all' block is inside the 'forever' 
loop. Remember, commands inside the loop are repeated. 
With every loop, everything on the screen is erased. 
That is 

an error. 

To fix the error: 

• Move the'erase all'block to the start of the program. 

Run and check 

Another way to find errors is to run the program. The 
programmer ran the program and found the sprite did not 
move. What you see 
when you run a program gives a clue 
to the error. 

In this case, 
there is a problem with the 'move' block. The 'move' block 
uses 
the 'answer' block. But there is no input question. So the 'answer' 

Computer Science T D 3 M
To fix the error: 

Computer Science T D 3 M
• Make a block that asks, 
"How many steps?" 

Put that block into the program - you decide 
where. 

Compare output to requirement 

If  you have fixed these two errors, then the 
program will run. But there is another error to fix. 
Read the requirement. 

Draw an endless  rainbow  line on the screen using 

a 'forever' loop. 

Compare this requirement with the output you 
see. 
It is not the same. 
To fix this error you must 

put a block inside the 'forever' loop to change 
the colour. 

Now when you run the program you should see 
an output like the one shown below. 

Computer Science T D 3 M
Make the program shown in this lesson, with all 
the errors fixed.

number input by the user.

In the classroom, a robot assistant will learn about your progress and how 
you study. The assistant will set you individual projects and find learning 
materials that are best for you. 

Robot vehicles 

Robot cars are also called autonomous cars. 
Autonomous means the car works automatically 
with no need for any human help. An autonomous 
car does not need a driver. It has sensors 
that can 

detect pedestrians, other cars and road signs. 
The 

controller uses 
the information from the sensors 
to 

operate the accelerator, brakes and steering. 

At any moment there will be different ways a 
robot car can deal with a situation on the road. For 
example, does it brake or swerve to avoid a collision? 
Al will help the car make the best decision. 

Cars in the future will look different to cars today. An autonomous car does 
e 
not need a steering wheel or pedals. Seats do not all need to face forward.

what robots can do now and how they are developing. 

Computer Science T D 6 M
You have been asked to design a robot. The robot should throw 
tennis balls to a student to help them practise catching. The robot 
needs to throw the balls safely. 

1  Draw the robot. Mark at least one part of the robot used for 

sensing. Mark at least one part used for moving. 

2  Describe the sensors your robot needs to decide where and how 

far to throw the ball. Describe how the robot might throw the ball. 

3  It would be useful for the robot to know if the student has caught 

the ball. What type of sensor would it need? 
There is more than 

one right answer to this question. 

If  you have finished the activities above and want an extra 
challenge, try these: 

4  The robot could throw the ball to different places - sometimes 

to the left, sometimes to the right, and at different heights. 

But not too far away so the catch is impossible. How could 

you change the robot to work in this way? 

S  A robot could use AI to develop the catcher's skills. 
The 

robot will learn where the catcher finds it easy or difficult to 

catch a ball. For 
example, if the robot learns the catcher finds 

high balls or balls to the left difficult, it can give the catcher 

practice with these types of throws. What sensors 

can you use so the robot knows if the ball has been 

caught? Write an algorithm to explain how your robot 

will work.

Using computers for learning is fun. The classroom is a much better place to 
learn when we behave with respect. You should always behave respectfully 
towards your teacher and classmates. You should treat equipment with 
care. Remember, someone else will need to use the equipment after you 
have finished with it. 

This unit gives you a general guide to behaving in the right way when using 
computers. Your school will have its own rules. Make sure you know them. 

Behave respectfully towards your teacher 

Working on computer projects often means you work on your own or in 
small groups. There will be times when your teacher needs to talk to the 
class. 
When this happens, stop typing and turn to face your teacher. 

Rules for sharing computers and equipment 

Remember that you are sharing computers and equipment with other 
students. Make sure equipment is tidy and in its correct place when you 
have finished using it. Here are some general rules: 

• Be patient and take turns when sharing equipment. 

• Do not use equipment for longer than you need to. 

• Do not adjust equipment without permission. 

• Tell your teacher if equipment is broken or needs attention. 

• Leave equipment as you find it. 

• Keep your work area tidy. Don't eat or drink at your 

computer. A spilled drink can be dangerous near 
electrical equipment. 

Computer Science T D 6 M
• Be polite. Think about how you would feel if you received the email or 

message. 
Talk to people online as though you are face to face. 

• Report anything you see that is frightening or upsetting. 

• Help others to report problems. 

• Report any behaviour that seems 
dangerous. 

Be safe and help others to stay safe 

If a classmate is having a problem using a software application or writing 
a program, it is good to help.  If  you are asked, offer an explanation but 
don't take over. Do not touch your classmate's computer. You could make 
the problem worse. Offer a solution and let your friend solve the problem. 

Computer Science T D 6 M
Work with a partner. Sit at the computer and ask 
your partner to help you with a problem. For 
example, you could ask them to explain how to 
create a new folder. 

Let your partner explain the task and help you. 

Then discuss how helpful your partner was. Were 
you confused at any point? Could your partner 
have explained anything better? 

Now change positions so that you offer the help. 

Computer Science T D 6 M
Later in this unit you will create your own  web page.  Before you do that, 

think about what a web page is. 
What parts - or components - does it 

contain? The main web page components are shown below. 

Components of a web page 

Headings:  These are short 

descriptions that tell you what 
a web page or text is about. 
A heading  is larger than normal 

text so that it stands out. 

Images:  Most websites use 
images  as well as text. Images 

can be photographs, drawings 

or cartoons. Images make a web 

page more interesting and easier 

to understand. 

Links: 
When you click a  link  on 

a web page, you leave the page 
you are on and go to a new 

page. You use links to find new

information on a subject. Links are also called hyperlinks. A hyperlink can 
be text or an image. 

Logo:  Most websites use a  logo.  The logo tells you who owns the website. 
If  the website is owned by a company, the company logo will usually be at 

the top of the web page. 

Menu: A menu  helps you to find your way around the web pages that 

make up a website. Clicking on a menu option takes you directly to another 

pa rt of the website. 

Text: 
Text is used on a web page to give information or instructions. Text 

should be clear and relevant to the subject of the page. Too much text can 
e 
put off a reader by making a page difficult to read. 

Computer Science T D 6 M
Before you start to create a web page, make a plan. Draw a simple outline 
plan showing how the components will fit together. Start with a rectangle 
to represent the computer screen. 
Then divide the rectangle into smaller 
sections to show where you will put images, text, and so on. 
This type of 

design is 
called a  wireframe.

Your 
teacher will tell you which web page editor to use at school. There are 
free web page editors that you can use at home. This unit uses 
a web page 

editor called Wix. Ask permission from an adult before using web editing 
software at home. 

Sections of a web page 

A web page has three sections. 

Header:  An area at the top of a web page. The header is used for a logo and 

the name of your web page. 

Body:The  main part of your web page. It contains the text and images you 
want to share. 

Footer:  An area at the bottom of the web page. If you look at the bottom 
of most web pages, you will see 
that the footer is used for links to site 

documents and policies. You won't use a footer in this unit. 

Getting started 

When you open your web page editor for the first time, you will be asked to 
create a new website. When you create the site, you will be asked to select a 
template for your site. Choose a blank template. Using a blank template will 
make it easier for you to learn the basics of web page design. 

Adding text to your page 

1  Choose the 'Add' option from the toolbar on the left of the screen. 

2  Choose 
'Text'from the 'Add' menu. 

3  Choose a paragraph style from the list if you want to add text. Or choose 

a heading style to add a heading. 

4  A box will appear on your web page. Drag the box to the position you 

want it on your page. Then type your text inside it. 

Computer Science T D 6 M
Add a text box to your web page with the heading 
'Did you know?' Do some research and add an 
interesting fact about your subject in the text box. 

Computer Science T D 6 M
Adding an image to a web page makes the page 
more interesting.  It  can also make the web page 
easier to understand. Make sure you choose images 
that work with the text on your web page. 

Be safe and responsible 

Be 
careful about the images you add to web pages.

use content on your web pages if 
you have permission. A tool like Wix 
will provide you with images that 
you can use. 
You also learned how 
to find and use Creative Commons 

images.  If  you are in any doubt 
about copyright, ask your teacher.

Sometimes it can be difficult to know where to start with a problem. A good 
method is to start with a simple version of the problem. A programmer 
might make a program that solves 
the simple problem. Then they will add 
extra features. 

That is 
the method you will use. 
Let's 
start by making a program that solves 
this simple problem: 

Calculate a total by adding  one 
number 
input by the user. 

Plan the variables 

The program must have variables. They will store the values. 
-
Control 
• 
What's your name? -

Sensing  -

• Scratch has a ready-made variable called 'answer'. 
It  is 
one of the  I 
ight 
blue 'Sensing' 
blocks.  It  stores 
the value input by the user. 

• You 
will need one other variable. It will store the total. The total will start 
e  withthevalueO. 

Computer Science T D 6 M
Create an algorithm 

Computer Science T D 6 M
So, 
now you have made all of these decisions, you are ready to make an 

algorithm  -  the set of steps needed to solve a problem. The algorithm 
works as a plan when you make a program. 

The algorithm looks like this: 

Set 
total 
to 
0 

Input 
a number 

Add number 
to 
total 
to 
give 
the 
new total 

Output 
the 
total 

Create a program 

Now you will make a Scratch program to match this 
algorithm. You will need Scratch skills. 

You must know how to: 

• make a variable 

• set the value of the variable 

• use 
the 'ask' 
block 
to get input 

• use operators to add and join values 

• use 
the 'say' block for program output. 

If  you can't remember how to do these things, 
look back at Student Book 5. 

The completed program is shown on the right.

does. 
You must think about commands before the loop, 
inside the loop, and after the loop. 

Before the loop 

Before the loop, the total is set to 0. 
This is the right 
command. The tota I shou

Inside the loop 

Inside the loop, you will see commands for these two actions: 

• Add the total to the answer to give the new total. 

• Input the answer. 

These commands are the wrong way round. The variable'answer'is added 
before it is input.

How to save time 

Computer Science T D 6 M
Writing a computer program is a lot of work. So programmers reuse and 
repurpose their programs. 

•  Reuse  means using the same program for a new task. For example, a 
programmer made a program to add up the bill in a restaurant. He 
reused the same code to add up the bill in a supermarket. 

•  Repurpose  means making some changes to a program so it does 
a new thing. For 
example, a programmer made a program to add 
17% 
sales tax to an invoice. She repurposed it for another business 
that wanted to add a 10% service charge to invoices. Objects can be 

repurposed too - in this picture, a plastic bottle has been repurposed 
as a growing container. 

Advantages 

Why do programmers reuse and repurpose?There are several advantages. 

•  Saves time and work:  It takes less 
work and less 
time to make small 
changes to a program, compared to writing a whole new program. 

•  Less 
risk of an error:  You have already checked the program for errors. 

You have used the program so you know it works. Repurposing the 
program is less risky than writing a new program. 

•  Teamwork:  Programmers often work in teams. Sharing 
your programs with others is good teamwork. 

New requirement 

You have made a program that adds up a series of numbers to find the 
total. Now you will repurpose the program to work out the average. 

Remember an  average  is worked out like this: 

• calculate the total of a series of numbers

How to change the program 

You must adapt the program. 

Computer Science T D 6 M
1  Make a new variable to store the average. 

2  Calculate the average. 

3  Output the average. 

Make a new variable 

Computer Science T D 6 M
You know how to make a variable. Create a new variable for the program, 
with the name 'average: 

Calculate the average 

You know that the average is calculated from the total divided by 
the number of inputs. 

• The total is stored as a variable. 

• The loop repeats 10 
times, so the number of 

inputs is 10. 

So the average is calculated as the total divided 
by 10. Here is the block that sets 
this value.

Computer Science T D 6 M
In this lesson you will be given a ready-made algorithm. You will see how a 
programmer turns an algorithm into a Scratch program. 

There are lots of different programming languages as well as Scratch. An 
algorithm can be turned into a program in any programming language. 

You have learned how programmers reuse and repurpose code. They can 
also reuse and repurpose algorithms. This saves 
time and makes it easier for 

programmers to share ideas.

Digital citizen of the future 

It is important that algorithms are designed to work fairly and treat 
all people equally. For 
example, a medical school used an algorithm 
to help decide who to admit for training to be a doctor.  It  was 

important that the algorithm was fair to all candidates. The inputs 
to the algorithm were factors such as exam results and voluntary 

work experience. 
The algorithm did not input factors such as family 
background or gender, which do not affect your suitability to be 
a doctor.

One way to do this is 
to 'borrow' commands and structures from programs 
they have already made. They can combine commands from more than 
one program to do a new task. In this lesson you will look at an example. 

Programs you have made 

In this unit you have made programs that: 

• count the number of values entered using a conditional loop (Lesson 
3.5) 

• calculate an average using a counter loop 

(Lesson 
3.4). 

Now you will make a program that combines 

features from both of these programs. It will 
cal 
cu 
late an average using a conditional loop. 

How to combine features from 
programs you have made 
Program to count inputs 

Load the program you made that counts the number 
of inputs. 

You will see 
this version is adapted so that it does 
not  count the final 'X' as one of the values. Make sure 
your program is adapted like this. 

Computer Science T D 6 M
Add 'borrowed' commands 

Computer Science T D 6 M
Now you will add some new commands to the program. You will 'borrow' 
commands you developed in your previous work. Here are the things you 
need to do. 

• Create a variable called 'total' and a variable called 'average'. 

• Set'total'to 0. 

• Add each input value to 'total' (inside the loop). 

• At the end of the program, set 'average' to 'tota I' 
divided 
by 'counter'. 

• Output the value of'average'. 

These are all things you have done before. Think back to 
remember how it is done. 

The commands you will need 

All the program blocks you need are shown on the right. 
Fit these blocks into the 'counter' program to complete 
the task.

Last year, you created a game

parrot to reach an apple. The 
position of each sprite was set using

In this unit you will create a game where it is a 
frog's birthday. The frog tries to get his birthday

screen design for the first version of the game. 

x/y  coordinates. If you have forgotten 
what  x/y  coordinates are, look at 
Book 5. In this lesson you will use 

x/y  coordinates to control the 

movement of a sprite. 

The example in this book uses 
two sprites - a frog and a gift. The backdrop 
is a night-time scene. 
You can choose any backdrop or sprites that you like. 

Starting values 

Click on the frog sprites. Now you will write a short 
program which will set the starting position and the 

size of the frog. A  script  is a short program that controls 
one thing - for example a sprite. We will use 
'program' 

to mean the whole game with several sprites, and 
'script'to mean the code that controls one sprite. 

The picture on this page shows the script for the frog. 
It will begin when the user presses 
the green flag. That 

will start the game. 

How to get the frog to move 

This script does not make the frog move. You will add commands 
so that the user can move the frog using the arrow keys. 
You learned in 
Unit 3 that it is good to start with a simple version. So you will make the frog 
move up the screen if the user presses 
the up arrow. Later you 
can add other commands so the other arrow keys work. 

Change they coordinate 

An  x/y  coordinate  is a number value. It represents the position 
of a point on the screen. 
They coordinate sets how far up or 

down the screen a point is. Points higher on the screen have 
a bigger  y  coordinate value. Increasing they coordinate of 

set size to • 
% 

Computer Science T D 6 M
These blocks will add 10 to they coordinate if 

the user presses 
the up arrow. 

Make this script by joining blocks together. 

Forever loop 

Computer Science T D 6 M
You want the frog to move not just once but over 

and over. So you need to put the movement 
blocks inside a forever loop. This picture shows 

the finished frog script. 

The gift 

The second sprite is a picture of a gift. You will 

make a script for this sprite. The gift does not 

move, but the script will set the starting values: 

• Set size 
to 50%. 

• Set the  x  value to 0. Set they value to 150. 

There is no picture of this script - see if you can 

make it yourself.

this type of 

A  conditional loop  is a loop controlled by a logical test. 
The conditional loop block is shown on the right. 

Add a conditional loop 

If you play the game, you will see that the snake moves 
on the screen. 
The snake will keep moving forever (while 
the program is running). 

Then add a 'forever' loop to make the snake move 
backwards and forwards across the screen. 
The'rotation' 
block means the snake stays facing the right way. 

You can create this script without help, using the skills 
you have already learned. 

• Set 
x  and  y  coordinates to 0. 

• Set size 
to 50%. 

• Start when the user presses 
the green flag. 

Next, make a script to control the snake (or other'danger').  It  should include 
these commands: 

First, 
find and insert the snake sprite into the game. If you don't like snakes, 
you can choose something else! Remember, games should be fun. 

To make the game more exciting, you will add a danger. You will add a 
snake who can catch the frog and stop him reaching his birthday gift.

this case the snake will move until it 'catches' the frog. Then it will stop.

the snake waits for two seconds, 
then jumps to a 

random position on the screen. Does 
this make the 

game easier or harder? For the rest of this unit, you 

may use either snake script.

There are now two different backdrops in the frog game.

frog script apart, change the loop, and then fit it all back together again. 

What happens if the frog touches the gift? 

If  the frog touches the gift, the game will stop. 

Add these commands at the end of the script: 

• The frog says 
"Happy birthday to me''. 

• The game stops. 

The command blocks should come after the conditional loop.

If the frog touches the gift, the backdrop will change. You should change 
your backdrop into a party picture.

Make a module called 'startup'. Put the start commands from the frog

backdrop and position of the frog. 

Computer Science T D 6 M
In the last lesson, you made a module. A module stores a set of commands. 

The module has a name chosen by the programmer. 

A programmer can use a module in their programs. When the computer sees 

the name of a module in the program, it will carry out all the commands 
stored in the module. 

Advantages of modules 

Most programming languages use modules. In some programming 
languages, modules are called procedures or functions. Storing commands 

in modules has many advantages for programmers: 

• It makes 
programs 
shorter 
and easier 
to read. 

• Programmers can use a module in more than one part of their program. 

That saves time and effort. 

• Programmers can use modules in new programs. They can share them 

with other programmers. That makes everyone's work easier. 

Modules in Scratch 
• 

A module is like a mini-program. It stores a series 
of commands. 

The module you made in the last lesson stores all the movement 
commands. 

My 
Blocks 

In Scratch, modules are called 'My Blocks: Click the red dot that 
says 'My Blocks'. 
You will see one block available to use. It is called 

'movement: This is the block you made in the last lesson. 

You have made a new Scratch block! You can use 
this block just like any 

other Scratch block. What will this block do?  It  will do all the commands 
that you put into the module. 

Use the module in your program 

-

Make 
a Block 

Computer Science T D 6 M
Drag the red 'movement' block into the frog script. 
Now the script looks like this picture. 

When you run the game, the frog will move. All the 
arrow keys will work. All the different commands 
that you made will work. That single red block 
stores all the commands. 

Make more modules 

If  you have time, make and use more modules in 
your games program. 

For example, make a module called: 

• 'startup'to store all the starting commands that 
come before the loop in this module 

• 'endgame'to store all the commands from the 

end of the game. 

Use 
the modules you make in the frog script. That 

shou Id make it short and easy to read.

You must edit the scripts you have made, so they 
work with the maze.

Change the frog script to load the maze backdrop 
and put the frog in the right place. The values in this 
image match the maze we provided.  If  you use a 
different maze, you may need different values. 

Note:  If  you made a startup module, you will need to 
edit that instead. 

Movement module

Computer Science T D 6 M
Set the  x/y  coordinates of the gift to -25 and 150. 
That will 

put it at the end of the maze.  If  you use a different maze 

you may need different values. 

Sense if the frog touches the maze wall 

You will change the frog script so the frog can't go through 
the walls of the maze. Look at the light blue 'Sensing' 

blocks. Find the block which senses 
if the frog touches a 

colour. Click on the colour. 

Set all the colour values to 0. Now the test will be True if 

the frog touches the black walls of the maze. 

Go back to the start 

Put the 'Sensing' block into an 'if' structure.  If  the frog 
touches the wa II then it must go back to the start of the 

maze. 
The frog started with  x/y  values of 25, -150. 

Use 
a 'go to' block to send the frog back to that place. 

The final picture shows the completed 'if' structure. 

Put the structure inside the frog script. 

Now you can play the game.

the spaceship jump to a new space location. 

Here are three different modules. Each module 
stores different commands. The modules are called 
x, 
y  and z.

to a random place on the screen. 
Which module 

should she use?

In this unit you will plan and carry out a survey in your school. You will 
use a digital device to collect data. You will use a spreadsheet to store 

and analyse the data. You will use presentation software to share your 
survey results and analysis. 

Collecting data with analogue and 
digital devices 

People have designed and used machines to collect data 

for many years. 

Chart recorders are  analogue  devices that were used to record 
different values (sometimes called parameters) on rolls of paper. 

A polygraph machine is a kind of chart recorder. A polygraph is 
sometimes used as a lie detector, as shown in the image. Each line 
on the graph paper shows the measurement of one parameter. 
Polygraph machines also record parameters for breathing, 
sweating and blood pressure. 

Nowadays, analogue chart recorders are often replaced by digital 
data loggers. The most famous kind of data logger is a flight  data 
recorder  (FDR). 
A FDR 
is 
fitted in most aircraft.  It  is a multi-channel 
recorder. It records at least 88 different parameters during a flight.

In this unit you will 
investigate the noisiest 
and busiest part of your 
school. What parts of 
your school are noisy and 
busy? What times of day 
are most busy? Can you 
agree on a single time and 
place to investigate?

and noisiest 
areas 
of our school 
at different times 
of the day. 

Find 
out what people feel 
about the 
space 
and noise 
at these 
times. 

Choosing the data you need to collect 

When you have decided on your survey goal, choose what data you need 
to collect to meet the goal. There are two types of data. 

•  Quantitative data  is numerical. It is used to measure and compare. In 
the example, the quantitative data is numbers of people and noise levels. 

•  Qualitative data  is 
descriptive. In the example, qualitative data will 

describe how classmates feel about the noise levels in school. 

Choosing a survey method 

Once you know what data you need, you can choose the way to collect it. 
This is 
called your survey method. Survey methods include: 

• questionnaires, which can be on paper or online - they are used to 
collect quantitative and qualitative data 

• interviews - they are used 
for qualitative data. 

• measuring devices (digital or analogue) - they are used to collect 

quantitative data. 

In the unit survey, digital measuring devices and interviews will be used to 
e 
collect  data. 

Computer Science T D 6 M
To make sure you choose the right technology, think about devices that can 

record the data you need. 
Think about specialist devices. 
Think about how 
you can use devices such as smartphones and tablets.

You need to agree a sample time for this data.  If  you collect data at 
different times or in different places, you need to use 
the same sample time 

• the noise level. 

• the number of people 

In this survey, there are two quantitative data items:

Qualitative data 

The qualitative data is 
the recorded answers to a survey question. You can 

use the voice recorder app on a smartphone or tablet. Ask each interviewee 

for permission before you record their answer. 

Write down the question before you start. Your question could be: 

How do you feel about the noise level in this location? 

This is called an open question. This means people can't answer with just 

'yes' or 'no: The answers shou Id tell you more a bout how people feel.

Computer Science T D 6 M
Data accuracy is important to businesses. 
Errors 
can cause big problems. 

They can be difficult to find when there is a lot of data. This is why software 

apps have data checks 
that can help you spot mistakes. 

One type of data check is  validation.  Validation means that you decide 
on rules called  validation criteria.  The software checks all data against 
the criteria. If data does not match the criteria, then you know the data 
is wrong. 

How to add data validation to a data table 

You will use number-based validation to check the'Weight'field. You will 

check the data using two criteria. 

• The weight must be a whole number. 

• The weight must be bigger than zero.

Computer Science T D 6 M
Data entry or input is an important task for any business. 

There can be problems with typing data. 

• It can take a long time to input all the data. 

Computer Science T D 6 M
• The data may be inconsistent. This means that data may not be entered 

in the same way every time. 

What is list validation? 

List 
validation  makes data input simpler. The user does not need to type 
data. They choose the right value from a list. 

This has many advantages. 

• Choosing from a list can be quicker than typing. 

• There is less 
chance of making mistakes. 

• The data is consistent (the same every time). 

How to add list validation 

You will add list validation to column C of your data table. 

• Click on the 'C' at the top of column  C. 
This will select the whole column. 

• Open the'Data'tab and click on 'Data Validation' like you did in the last 
lesson. 
The 'Data Validation' window will open.

Computer Science T D 6 M
In the last lesson you used a formula to work out the charge for delivery of 
a parcel. The customer does not have to pay the charge until the parcel has 
been delivered. 

In this lesson you will use a  logical test  to work out how much each 
customer has to pay today. 

A logical test checks a statement and finds out if it 
is 
True or False. 
A logical test on the statement'This 

parcel has been delivered: can have the answer 

The package has 

been delivered 

• True (yes, it has been delivered) or 

• False 
(no, it has not been delivered). 

You can use an IF formula in your data table to 
calculate different values depending on the result 
of a logical test. 

The field that holds the answer to the logical test is 

Yes 

the 'Delivered' field.  It  holds the answer 'Yes' 
or 'No' for each parcel. 

How to start an if formula 

You will add a field to the end of the data table. It is called 'to pay'. This field 
will show how much the customer has to pay. 

To start the formula, type: =IF(

How to save a file 

Clipboard rs  I 

If  you are working in an application such as a word processor, 
there 
are two ways to save a file. You can use the File menu or click the Save 
icon.  If  your file already has a name, it will be saved with the same 
name.  If  it is a new file, you need to enter a file name before you can 
save the file. You will learn more about choosing a good name for your 
file in Lesson 1.6. 

How to copy a file 

You can reduce the risk of losing important work by making a copy of 
the file. The copy is called a  back-up file. 

• Find the file in File Explorer. 

• Right click your mouse over the file, then select Copy from the menu 
that appears. 

• Move to the folder where you want to save your back-up. Right click 
your mouse and select Paste from the menu. 

How to find a file

Saving work correctly is important. Failing to save work correctly 
could mean: 

• you will lose work and must start again 

• you may not be able to find work when you need it again. 

Rules to help you when you are saving files 

Rule 1: Use a helpful file name 

When you save a file, you must give it a name. Choose a name that 
describes the information in your file. 

Example:  You have just completed a science homework assignment 
on big cats. The assignment is 
to be handed in on 24 April 2020. 

A good file name is: 

• Science_homework_big_cats_24_April 

Rule 2: Use folders to organise your work 
v 
My work 

Using folders to organise your files can help you to find your 
work. Folders also allow you to use shorter file names. You can 
create a folder to hold all your science work. Now your big cats 
file name can be shortened to: 

v 
Science 

• Homework_big_cats_24_April

Get used to saving your work regularly and often. Don't wait until 
you have finished a piece of work before saving it. There will be times 
in between typing that you pause to think about what you will write 
next. That is a good time to save your work. 

Rule 4: Be careful not to overwrite your files 

Computer Science T D 4 M
Sometimes you will see a warning on screen 
like the one opposite. The warning tells you

Sometimes you have a file that is so important 
that losing it would be a disaster. For 
example, it might be an

reduce the risk of losing important work  by  making a copy of the file. 
The copy is called a back-up file.

You can use other symbols to improve your search. Two symbols

If  you use double quote marks, the search engine looks for the

Use 
an asterisk if you aren't sure about a word in a song or book

However, the web has a bad side too. Some of the information 
you find will be misleading or incorrect. You cannot trust 
everything you see 
on the web. 

Be 
alert, act responsibly and ask for help when you need it.  If  you 
are careful, then you can enjoy learning on the web. 

How to check content 

Is it true? 

You should ask this question every time you use 
the web. 

Sometimes, people get facts wrong by mistake. Sometimes, 
people deliberately try to mislead you. Here are a few checks you 
can carry out to make sure your content is good quality. 

•  Can you check the facts?  Check the information you find on 

a website against other websites before you use it. 

•  When was the information written?  Check that your 
information is up to date. 

•  Is the information on a site you trust?  As you bookmark 

websites, you will start to build a library of sites you have used 
many times and that you trust. 
e 
• 
Is it fact or opinion? 
Are opinions backed up by facts? 

Computer Science T D 4 M
Revisit 
a website you have used in this

•  Chatting  Do not chat with strangers on 
line. It is safer to chat 

to people you know well. It is safest if you chat to people you 
know in real life. Don't accept friend requests from strangers. 
If  you feel uncomfortable about someone who sends you 
a message, you can block them. 

•  Sharing  Do not share your personal information or 
photographs with strangers. Never share your address or 
phone number with strangers. 

•  Opening files  Do not open pictures or other files from people 
you don't know.  If  you receive something by email from 
someone you don't know, do not open it.  If  you are in doubt, 
ask an adu It you trust for help. 

•  Settings  Social media and games sites allow you to set 

privacy levels.  Privacy levels let you decide who can see 
what you share online.  If  you are unsure how to use privacy 
settings, ask a family member or teacher to help you. Check 
your friends list. Make sure you haven't added strangers by 
accident. 

Be kind and respectful 

The way you behave on line is important. Be 
kind and respectful 
in the way you talk to people. Chat on line in the same way you 
would chat at home or in the classroom. 

If  someone you know is upset or frightened by something they 
have seen online, offer them help. Advise them to talk to a 
e 
trusted adult. 

Computer Science T D 4 M
If  you see 
a friend acting irresponsibly on line, share your

Reporting problems 

Computer Science T D 4 M
If  something scares 
or upsets you online, tell an adult. You 
will 
feel better once the problem is in the open. Remember, 
you are 
not to blame, and people want to help. 

• Tell a family member you trust and can talk to. 

• Talk to a teacher you trust. Your school may have a teacher 
responsible for dealing with online abuse and bullying. 

Write down what happened so you can remember the details 
when you talk to a trusted adult.

this lesson, look back at the 
lessons in Book 3. 

Computer Science T D 4 M
In this unit you will create a program to meet this requirement. 

Planning the program 

Programmers plan a program before they start to create the 
program. 
The 
plan helps 
them make 
the program. 

• The plan guides their work. 

• They can check their finished program against the plan. 

• The plan helps them to share their ideas with others. 

Plan for the quiz program 

A  program plan  sets out the inputs, processes 
and outputs of 
a program. Here is a plan for the quiz program: 

•  Input:  Ask a quiz question and get the answer. 

•  Process: 
Check if the answer is right. 

•  Output: 
Tell the user if the answer is right. 

You will create a program to match this plan. In this lesson, you 
will complete the input part of the program. 

Using scratch language 

You will use 
the Scratch programming language. Go to the 

Scratch website:

Almost all programs use  variables.  When you 
make a variable, you give it a name. A program 
command gives the variable a value. The 
variable will store the value. 

In this lesson you will make a variable. The

Remember that programs use operators to process 
values. In 
this lesson you will learn about  relational operators.  Relational 
operators compare two values. 

Three common relational operators are shown in this table.

Bigger than 

< 
Less 
than 

Logical test 

Computer programs often include a  logical test.  A logical test is 
a test that has the answer True or False. 
You can make a logical 
test by comparing two values using a relational operator. For 
example, 5  >  3 says 
'5 is bigger than 3~ 
This test is 
True. 

What about the test 100 < 50? 
Is it True or False? 

Conditional structure 

A logical test is used to control what the computer does. 

• If  the test is 
True, 
the computer does one thing. 

• If  the test is False, 
the computer does a different thing. 

This is called an  if structure  or a  conditional structure.  Your 
program will use a conditional structure. You will test if the 
answer to the quiz question is right.

In this lesson you will create a program to match the plan you 
made in the last lesson. 
Your program will include a logical test 
and a conditional structure. 

Look at the program you made before. Take away the block

Conditional structure (if

Click on the light orange dot labelled 'Control'to see 
'Control' blocks. You will see

The'if' block has two features: 

• a space at the top for a logical test 

• a space inside for actions if the test is 
true. 

Logical test 

Now you will make the logical test. You will use a 
relational operator.

There are two spaces, 
where you can put the two values. You 
want the program to test if'answer'  =  'solution' (that means the 
answer is the same as the solution). 

• The block that stores the user'answer' is in the 'Sensing' section 

(light blue blocks). 

• The block that stores the'solution' 

variable is in the 'Variables' section 
(dark orange blocks). 

Put these two blocks into the 'equals' block. 
The whole thing will look like this. 

Complete the program 

Put the logical test you made into the'if' 
block. It fits in at the top. The space at the 
top of the 'if' block is 
the same shape as the 

'equals' block. A white outline appears to 
show when you have put it in the right place. 

Now you need to make the sprite say 'You 
got it right!' Find the'say' block (it is one of 
the blue blocks). Change the words so the 
sprite says the right words. Then put it into 
the 'if' block. When you have finished, the

Computer Science T D 4 M
Find the block that changes the value of 'crash points' 
by 1. 
Change the number to -1. 

Put this block into the program. It should go inside the 
'if' structure. That is because the points will go down IF 
the spaceship hits the star. 

The game is complete! 

You have made a working game that you can play. Try it 
out for yourself. 

Computer Science T D 4 M
Create a variable to store crash 
points. 

Set the starting value. 

Add a block so that 'crash points' 
goes down by 1 if the spaceship 
hits the star. 

Add another block so that 
'crash points' goes down if the 
spaceship hits the planet. 

Computer Science T D 4 M
Add an extra command to the program so that: 

• if the spaceship hits the star 

• it jumps to a random location. 

Now add the same command if the spaceship 
hits the planet. 

Computer Science T D 4 M
You will use 
th is block to make the spaceship jump IF it hits the 

star. Where would you put the block into the program to make 
this happen? Can you make the same change if the spaceship 
hits the planet? 

Get treasure 

Change the game so there are two variables. 

•  Crash points  go down ifthe spaceship hits the star. 

•  Treasure points  go up if the spaceship hits the planet. 

Make a new variable called 'treasure points: 

Find the block which makes 'crash points' go down by 
1 if the spaceship hits a planet. Make changes to the 
block. 

• Change'crash points'to'treasure points'. 

• Change the number  -1  to 1. 
e 
Run the game and see 
the difference.

Chase the planet 

Computer Science T D 4 M
Find the program that controls the planet. Make 
changes to the program so the planet is quite small 
and moves quite fast. 

Now when you play the game, it is harder for the 
spaceship to catch the planet. 

Make more stars 

You can tell any sprite to make a clone of itself. 
A  clone  is an exact copy. 

The code goes into the program that controls the 
star sprite.

In this unit you will learn more 
about using your spreadsheet 
data in other documents. 

Computer Science T D 4 M
A spreadsheet is a grid of columns and rows. Where a column 
crosses 
a row, it makes a  cell.  The  cell reference  is the name of a 

cell. It is made of the column letter and the row number. 

Values and labels 

Spreadsheet cells can hold values or labels. 

•  Values  are numbers and calculations. Values are displayed on 

the rig 
ht of the cell. 

•  Labels  are all other content, usually words. Labels are 
displayed on the left of a cell.  If  a label is 
too big it will spill 

into the cells next to it. 

In this lesson you will make a spreadsheet with data about 
what you and your classmates want to be 
when they grow up.

A  percentage  shows a fraction as an amount out of 100. 
You can work out what percentage of a total any value 
is. 
You divide the value by the total. 

What is a spreadsheet formula? 

A spreadsheet formula makes the computer carry out 
a calculation. Every spreadsheet formula begins with 
an equals sign:= 

How to make a spreadsheet formula 

Th 
is is how to work out the percentage of students who 
want to be a doctor. 

• Start with the number of students who want to be 
a doctor. 

• Divide by the total number of students in the 
class survey. 

To put a value from a cell into a formula, use the cell 

reference. 
Click on the cell that holds the value. The 
value will be added to your formula. 

Start the formula 

The formula goes into the cell next to the number value.

Coloured dots and blocks 

You will make a Scratch program. A program 
is made of  commands.  Commands tell the 
computer what to do. 

Scratch commands are blocks. You 
fit the blocks 
together. That makes the program. 

Different types of blocks are different colours. 

• 'Motion' blocks are blue. 

• 'Sound' blocks are pink.

➔  four golden rules to help you to search the web. 
.--► 
how to carry out 
basic world wide web 
searches. 
You learned 
Four golden rules 
1 Choose the right key words 

Make sure you understand the question you need to 
answer. Before you enter anything into your search engine: 

• Make a list of  key words. 

how to use a search engine to 
find information quickly on 
the web. In this lesson you will 

review the search techniques 
that you learned last year. 

• Underline the most important key words. 

Make sure that the question you type in the search engine contains 
the important key words. Your question does not need to include 
punctuation or short joining words like 'is' and 'the'. 

2 Choose the right search engine 

There 
are many search 
engines 
that you can use. 
Google, 
Bing 
and 

Yahoo are examples. Try using different search engines. Find out which 
one works best for you. 

Some search engines are designed for young people. The advantages 
of using a child-friendly search engine are: 

• The links are easier 

for you to read and 
understand. 

• You are less likely 

to see unsuitable 
web pages. 

• There are fewer 
adverts.

Computer Science T D 5 M
Adding a  web page  to your  bookmarks  makes it easy to find next 
time you want to use it. You don't have to search for the page again. 
You click on the link in your bookmarks list and go straight to the page. 

Your bookmarks can be a good place to start a search.  Websites  you 
have found useful in the past might provide the information you need. 

4 Try again 

Sometimes a search does not give you the information you need. If 
that happens, try again. 

• Try to think of different key words. 

• Will a different search engine give better results? 

• Will any of your bookmarked pages lead you to helpful 
information?

results. It uses 
several methods. 

•  How popular is a page?The  most popular web pages are shown 

on the first page of search results. A page is popular if many other 

sites link to it. 

•  How upto date is a page?  Web pages that change often are shown 

near the top of the search results. Adding new information to a web

.---,.._.., Last year, you 
.---~ 
learned how to make 
and use variables in 

Scratch programs. If you need 

help with making variables in  j 
this lesson, look back at the 
lessons in Student Book 4. 

Computer Science T D 5 M
Make 
a program for a student so they can 
practise the 
seven 
times 
table. 

Program plan 

Before a programmer starts work, they make a  program plan. 
A program plan sets out the steps to solve a problem. Another word 
for a plan to solve a problem is an  algorithm. 

A program plan sets out the inputs and outputs of a program. It also 
sets out the processes 
done by the computer, such as calculations. 

Here is a plan for this program: 

Input: 
Prompt with a question (for example, 'What is 7 times 5?'). 

Input the user's 
'answer'. 

Process: Store the 'solution'to the question. 

Compare the user's 
answer to the solution. Do they match? 

Output: 
If the answer matches the solution, output'You got it right!' 

Else, 
output'You got it wrong!' 

The word 'else' 
is used in programming. In this example, the 

computer will output 'You got it wrong!' if the answer does not 
match the solution. 

Variables 

A  variable  stores a value. You give every variable a name. Then you 
can use 
the value in your program. Two variables are mentioned in the 
program plan. 

In Scratch there is a ready-made variable called 'answer'. 
You can 
e 
make a sprite ask a question. The user's 
answer is stored in'answer'. 

Computer Science T D 5 M
You will also make a new variable called 'solution'. This 

variable will store the correct solution to the question. 

Click on 'Make a Variable'. 

Type the variable name 'solution'. 

The variable name is ticked. That means it will show 
on the main screen. Click to remove the tick. You don't 

want the user to see the solution.

are these good variable names? 

Think of alternative variable names which 
would be just as good. 

Extend the program to tell the user 

if their answer is right or wrong. 

Computer Science T D 5 M
Make a better plan 

Computer Science T D 5 M
The requirement is 
to create a program that allows the user to practise 
the seven times table. In the last lesson, you created a program that 
asks a question. The program always asks 
the same question. 

It will be better if the program asks a different'seven times' question 
each time. That will give the user more practice of the seven times 
table. 

In this lesson, you will change the program so that it asks a different 
'seven times' question every time you run it. Here is the improved plan. 

Input: 
Make a  random  number. 

Ask"What 
is 
7 
times 
the random number?" 

Input the user's 
'answer~ 

Process: Calculate the 'solution'to the question. 

Compare the user's 
answer to the solution. Do they match? 

Output: If the answer matches the solution, output'You got it right!' 

Else, 
output'You got it wrong!' 

In the last lesson you made a new variable called 'solution'. Now 
make another variable called 'random'. This variable will store the 
random number. 

Set a random value 

This program uses 
a random value. The computer will pick the random 

value. The value could be different every time. 

Green blocks a 
re 
'Operators~ 
They make new values. This block 

will pick a random value from 1 
to 10. 
Change the higher 

value to 12. 

Fit these two blocks together to give the 
random value to the new 'random' variable. 
o 
This block goes at the start of the program. 

Computer Science T D 5 M
Ask a random question 

Computer Science T D 5 M
The'join' operator joins two values together. 
When you find this operator on the Scratch 
website it joins 'apple' and 'banana'. Change 
the operator so it joins 'What is 7 times' to 
the 'random'variable. 

Now this block makes a random question. 

The growing program 

Now fit all the blocks together to 
create the program. Here is the 
program so far. 

• The program makes a random 
number. 

• It asks a random question. 

Computer Science T D 5 M
Run 
the program 1 
O 
more times. Keep a tally of the random 
number that appears each time. Do some numbers appear more 
often than others? 

Because 
the numbers are random, every number has the same 
chance of appearing. The tally count for each number should be 
the same. 
The more times you run the program, the more even the 
balance should be. If you have time, run the program lots more 
times to check this. 

Computer Science T D 5 M
Find the solution to the question 

Computer Science T D 5 M
Now the variable called 'solution' stores 
the correct answer to the question. Add the 
completed block to the program. 

Complete the program 

Now you can complete the program. Use 
an 

'if 
... else' block. Compare 'answer'to 'solution: 

and output 'You got it rig 
ht!' or 'You got it 

wrong!: 

Computer Science T D 5 M
Load the program you created in the last lesson. 
Add the extra 
commands shown in this lesson to complete the program. Run 
the 
program to make sure it works. You can run the program many 
times. The question will usually change each time. But because the 
question uses 
a random number, sometimes you will see 
the 

same question twice.

Computer Science T D 5 M
If  you have used Scratch before, you may have used a 'forever' loop. 
Any commands inside this loop will be repeated'forever' 
(until the program stops). 

There are other types of loop that you can use. 

The way that the program stops the loop is called an  exit condition. 
It is how you 'exit' from the loop. 

Types of loop 

There are two main types of loop. They have different exit conditions. 

• A  counter loop  (or  fixed loop)  repeats a set number of times. 

• A  conditional loop  (or  condition-controlled loop)  is 
controlled by 

a logical test. 

In this lesson you will plan and create a program with a counter loop. 

Change the plan 

The program you have made asks 
one question each time you run the 

program. A more useful test will ask many questions. In this lesson you 
will extend the program so that the sprite asks 1 
O 
random questions. 

Here is 
the new program plan. 

Repeat until there have been 10 loops. 

Input: 
Ask a question and get the user's 
answer. 

Process: Calculate the solution to the question. 

Output: 
If'answer'  =  'solution; output 'You got it right!' 

Else, 
output'You got it wrong!' 

Go back to the top of the loop. 

Computer Science T D 5 M
forever loop in 

Computer Science T D 5 M
The program you have made always asks 10 questions. Some 

people might like a different number of questions. 

Before the loop starts, ask the user how many questions they 
want. Then set the number of repeats to the user's 
answer. 

Computer Science T D 5 M
In the last lesson you created a program with a counter loop. It loops 
exactly 1 
O 
times. The test has exactly 1 
O 
questions. 

In this lesson you will change the program. 

• Before every test question, the program wil I ask the user if they 

want to stop the test. 

• If  the user types Y (for Yes) 
the loop will stop. 

This type of loop is called a conditional loop. A conditional loop is 
controlled by a  logical test.  A logical test compares two values. 
It gives the resu 
It True or False. 

Change the plan 

Here is the new program plan. 

Repeat until the user types 'Y~ 

Input: 
Ask a question and get the user's 
answer. 

Process: Calculate the solution to the question. 

Output: 
If 'answer';::; 
'solution: output 'You got it right!' 

Else, 
output'You got it wrong!' 

Input: 
Ask'Do you want to stop?' 

Go to the top of the loop. 

You must put the question 'Do you wantto stop?' inside the loop. That 
gives the user the chance to stop after every question. 

Create the test 

Your program will ask the user if they want to stop. If the 
user types 'Y'the program will stop. 

This block compares the user answer to the letter Y. 
e 
Make this 
test block. 
CIID 

Computer Science T D 5 M
This type of conditional loop is called a  repeat until loop. 
It starts with a logical test. The commands inside the loop 
will repeat until the logical test is 
True. 

• Add the logical test at the top of the loop. 

• Add the question 'Do you want to stop?' inside the loop. 

The loop will repeat until the answer to the question is Y. 

The finished program 

All the other commands you have made go inside the loop. 
These commands will repeat until the logical test is 
True. 

The finished program is shown opposite.

treasure is. 
Write down the  x  and  y  coordinates of the square, but don't 

show your partner. 

Challenge your partner to a game. Your partner guesses 
where the 
treasure is. 
If they are wrong, cross 
out that square. Continue until 
they find the right square. Now you can swap. You will try to find the 
treasure in your partner's island. 

To make the game more interesting, include a hidden danger such as 
a deadly scorpion. If your partner chooses that square, they are out of 
the game.

Start the program 

Computer Science T D 5 M
Every program needs a  starting event.  The starting event is how the 
user makes the program start. For your game you will use the green 

flag button to start the program. 

• Look at the yellow'Events'blocks. 

• Choose the green flag event block and drag it onto the stage. 

Next set the starting position of the parrot. 

• Look at the blue 'Motion' blocks. 

• Find the 'go to' block.  It  says 'go to  x:  ...  y:  ... 
'. 
There is 

space to enter  x  and  y  coordinates. 

• Put this block into the program. 

• Set the  x  and  y  coordinates for the parrot to 

x~  -200,  y  ~ 
0. 

Every 
time the program starts, the parrot will go to 
this position. 

The program so far is shown in the top picture opposite. 

Move the sprite 

The blue 'Motion' blocks make the sprite move. Find the 
'move 1 
0 steps' block. Add this to the program and then run 
the program. 

The parrot doesn't move very far. To make it move further, 
put the 'move 10 
steps' block inside a counter loop. The 
program so far is shown opposite. 

The move block is repeated 10 
times. When you run the 
program, the parrot moves further. 

Computer Science T D 5 M
Flap the wings 

Computer Science T D 5 M
parrot flap its wings. The different 'Looks'for a sprite are 
called  costumes.  For 
the parrot these are different 

wing positions. 

You will also make the sprite pause for a fraction of a 
second after each flap. That makes the movement 
more realistic. 

The new blocks you will need are shown opposite. Make 
sure you change the 'wait' value to 0.2 (two tenths of 
a second). 

Put the blocks inside the loop. 

If you have chosen a different sprite, the costume change 
will look different. But it will still be fun to try. 

Computer Science T D 5 M
The program blocks in your program have numbers 
in them: 

• the number of steps 

• the number of repeats 

• the number of seconds to wait between 
wing flaps. 

Change these values and see how your changes 
affect the program. 

Computer Science T D 5 M
Give the parrot an apple 

Computer Science T D 5 M
In this game the parrot is hungry. You will help the parrot find food to 
eat. You will make a program so the apple appears at a random place 
in front of the parrot. 

Use 
the skills you have already learned to add an apple sprite to the 
program. Set 
the size 
to 50. 

Move the apple 

Now you will make a short program to control the apple sprite. 

The starting event is the green flag. 

The new program only needs one more block. Use 
the 'go to' block to 

move the sprite to an  x  and  y  coordinate. 

Set the  x  and  y  values to 0 and fit the two blocks together. 

The program looks like this. 

Computer Science T D 5 M
Make x random 

Computer Science T D 5 M
• The smallest possible value for the  x  coordinate is -260. 

• The biggest possible value for the  x  coordinate is 260. 

Type these numbers in the 'random' block. 

Computer Science T D 5 M
Put the 'random' block into the program. The completed program looks 
like this. 

Computer Science T D 5 M
Add an extra sprite to the program, for 
example a strawberry. 

This block makes a sprite jump to a 

random location. 

Computer Science T D 5 M

You will change the program to show if the parrot has reached its 
dinner. You will add more commands to the program. 

Click on the parrot sprite. You will use the 'if ... else' block. You have 
used this block before in Unit 3. Add it to the program. It comes 
after the loop, when the parrot has finished moving. 

Sensing 

The light blue 'Sensing' blocks are used by the computer to 'sense' 

if an event happens. One of these blocks will sense if the parrot 
is 
touching the apple. Here is the block. Use 
the drop-down menu to 

choose 'Apple'. 

Computer Science T D 5 M
Complete the program 

Computer Science T D 5 M
• If the parrot touches the apple, the parrot 

says 
"Yum yum!" 

• Else, 
the parrot says 
"I'm hungry!" 

Here is 
the program with these changes. 

Run 
the program and you will see if the parrot 

gets its dinner. 

Computer Science T D 5 M
If  you have not done this already, add 
a strawberry to the game.  If  the parrot 
touches the strawberry, the parrot says 
"I like this dinner!"

Play the parrot game several times. Keep 
a tally of how often the parrot reaches 
the apple. What is 
the percentage? 

Computer Science T D 5 M
Use your skill 

Computer Science T D 5 M
The game you have made so far is not very good. The user does not 
need to use skill to play the game. The parrot might reach the apple or 
it might not. The result is random. Now you will change the program so 
the parrot asks you how many flaps to take. 

After you type a number (for example, 3), 
the parrot will flap its wings 

that many times. It will move forwards that many times. 

If  you input the right number, the parrot will get the apple. You must 
use your skill to choose the right number. 

Ask a question 

You 
used 
the 'ask' 
block in Unit 
3. Find 
this 

block and change the question to 'How many 

times shall I flap my wings?' 

Before you can insert a block into a program, 
you have to pull the blocks apart. Put the 
new block into the program before the loop. 
Then fit the blocks back together again. 

The start of the program is shown in the 
top picture. 

Enter a number 

The user can type an answer to the question. 

You learned in Unit 3 that the user's 
answer 

to a question is stored by the computer. The 
answer is stored as a light blue 'answer' block. 
You will put this block into the counter loop. 
The loop will repeat that number of times. 

For 
example, if you type 6 the loop will 

repeat six times. Run the program to see 
e 
what happens.

In this lesson you will make a new game called Chase 
Your 

Dinner! You will work independently and use 
the images to 

help you. Only start this project if you have completed all 
the other lessons in this unit. 

Start a new program. Choose a backdrop. Add two sprites: 

• One sprite is the food. 

• The other sprite will chase the food. 

You can use the parrot and apple again if you like. 
The 

example 
game in this lesson 
uses 
a robot and a muffin. 

Position the food 

Make a simple program for the food sprite so that it  moves 
to a random position on the screen. 

Position the chaser 

The other sprite chases the food. It is 
the chaser. Start a 
program for the chaser. Set the  x  and  y  coordinates and the 

direction as shown in this picture. 

How many degrees? 

Angles are measured in  degrees.  A right-angle 

is 90 degrees. 
This program will ask the user to 

type a number of degrees. The chaser will turn 

that many degrees. 

Use 
these blocks. 

Computer Science T D 5 M
Keep moving 

Computer Science T D 5 M
The picture opposite shows a conditional loop. 
The loop will repeat until the chaser touches 
the food. 

Inside the loop there are two commands: a 
command to keep moving forward, and a 
command to bounce off the edge of the screen. 
This means the chaser sprite will keep moving 
until it gets the food. 

Finishing touches 

You can add some finishing touches to 
the game. 

• Inside the loop, add commands to change 
the costume and to wait 0.2 seconds. 
This will 

make the movement more realistic. 

• After the loop is 
finished, the chaser has 

caught the food. Make the chaser say 

something like"! got my dinner!" 

The finished game 

The completed program looks like this. Check 

your work against this image. 

Computer Science T D 5 M
Change the program so that both the 
food and the chaser move about on 
the screen. 
That makes it harder for the 

chaser to catch the food.

Always follow the correct order when you edit your photos manually. 
This is called the  workflow. 

In the Microsoft Photos application the'Adjust'menu is organised in 
the correct order. 

1 Exposure:  Always start with the 'Light' setting. This changes the 

exposure of your photo.  If  the photo is too dark or too bright you can 
move the 'Light' slider slowly to reduce the exposure. 

2 Colour:  Next use 
the 'Colour' slider. Move the slider to the left to 
make the photo less 
colourful, until it is  monochrome.  Monochrome 
photos use the tones of just one colour, such as tones of grey. Move the 
sliderto the right to make the colours stronger and brighter. 

3 Composition:  Finally, you can crop your photo to improve the 
composition.

Photo editing software provides powerful tools to change photos. 
Sometimes you might want to remove something from a photo. 
Sometimes you might want to add something. Making changes like 
these is called  retouching. 

Use the spot fix brush to edit small areas 

The 
'Spot fix'tool can remove small marks on a photo. The spot fix tool 

samples  pixels around the area you want to retouch.  It  copies the 
area around the cursor. It uses 
this information to paint over the area 
you want to retouch. 

Computer Science T D 5 M
Use the clone tool to make bigger changes 

Some photo editing software provides a clone tool. The 
clone tool uses pixels from one part of the image to 
paint over pixels in another part. You can use cloning to 
remove whole objects in your photo.

The snack bar sells 

slices of pizza and desserts to customers. In this lesson you 

will use a spreadsheet to calculate the costs and the income 
of your pizza snack bar. 

to help a business make 

decisions about its products. 
J 

Spreadsheets contain two types of data: 

•  Values  -  these are numbers. Values are used in calculations. 

•  Labels  -  these are text. Labels are used to show what the values 

mean, so the spreadsheet is easier to understand. 

Look at the spreadsheet'My pizza snack bar'. 
The first worksheet lists 

the ingredients for a recipe called 'Pizza 

Napoli'. It only has labels. In this lesson 
you will enter the costs of the 

ingredients. 

How to enter data into a 
spreadsheet 

Click on a cell with the pointer to 
select it. 

Type the data you want to enter. Then 

press 
'Enter'to add the data to the cell. 

Now the spreadsheet includes labels 
and values. They are shown in different 

ways. 

• Labels are  left-aligned  -  they are at 

the left of the cell. 

• Values are  right-aligned  -  they are 

at the right of the cell.

You can also change the  format  of the values. Format means the style 

of something or how it is organised. In a spreadsheet use the 'Number 

Format'to choose the way values are shown. There are many different 

number formats such as decimal number, date and time, percentage, 

currency. 

The currency format shows values as amounts of money. In this lesson 

you will change the costs of the ingredients to currency values.

Computer Science T D 5 M
Profit is the money that a business makes from selling a product to a 

customer. Profit= income - costs. 

In this lesson you will calculate the profit from selling one portion 

of pizza. First decide the selling price of one portion of pizza. To make 

a profit, the selling price must be more than the cost of the ingredients. 

In this example the price is  S 
1.00. 
You can choose any value you like.
