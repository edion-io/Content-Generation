(Mathematics) (Word Problem, Explanation Exercise) D 6 (With Illustration)

Ingrid says, "I can multiply by 100 by adding two zeros." Explain why Ingrid is wrong.

\subsection{Answers}
Ingrid's statement is incorrect because simply adding two zeros to a number does not accurately represent multiplication by 100. For example, if you take the number 5 and add two zeros, you get 500, which is not the same as multiplying 5 by 100, which equals 500. However, this method only works for whole numbers and does not apply to decimal numbers or fractions.

(Mathematics) (Word Problem, Bead Calculation) D 4 (With Answer)

Nasreen has a packet of coloured beads. The packet contains 5 orange beads, 5 red beads, and 10 blue beads. Nasreen says, "Half the beads are blue." She is correct. Explain how you know.

\subsection{Answers}
To determine if Nasreen is correct, we first calculate the total number of beads: 
\[
5 \text{ (orange)} + 5 \text{ (red)} + 10 \text{ (blue)} = 20 \text{ beads}.
\]
Next, we find half of the total number of beads:
\[
\frac{20}{2} = 10 \text{ beads}.
\]
Since there are 10 blue beads, which is half of the total, Nasreen is correct.

(Mathematics) (Opinion Exercise) D 4 (With Answer)

Hasson says, "I would rather have \( \frac{3}{8} \) of \$36 than \( \frac{1}{4} \) of \$60 because \( \frac{3}{8} \) is bigger than \( \frac{1}{4} \)." Do you agree with Hasson? Explain your answer.

\subsection{Answers}
To determine whether you agree with Hasson, calculate \( \frac{3}{8} \) of \$36 and \( \frac{1}{4} \) of \$60. 
- \( \frac{3}{8} \) of \$36 is \( \frac{3 \times 36}{8} = \$13.50 \).
- \( \frac{1}{4} \) of \$60 is \( \frac{1 \times 60}{4} = \$15.00 \).

Since \$13.50 is less than \$15.00, you may disagree with Hasson.

(Mathematics) (Word Problem, Problem-solving) D 5 (With Illustration)

India has a bowl of fruit. \( \frac{1}{4} \) are apples, \( \frac{1}{3} \) are papayas, \( \frac{1}{6} \) are mangos, and the other fruit are bananas. Calculate the possible numbers of each fruit.

\subsection{Answers}
Let the total number of fruits be \( x \). Then:
- Number of apples = \( \frac{1}{4}x \)
- Number of papayas = \( \frac{1}{3}x \)
- Number of mangos = \( \frac{1}{6}x \)
- Number of bananas = \( x - \left(\frac{1}{4}x + \frac{1}{3}x + \frac{1}{6}x\right) \)

To find a common denominator, we can use 12:
- Number of apples = \( \frac{3}{12}x \)
- Number of papayas = \( \frac{4}{12}x \)
- Number of mangos = \( \frac{2}{12}x \)

Adding these fractions gives:
\[
\frac{3}{12}x + \frac{4}{12}x + \frac{2}{12}x = \frac{9}{12}x
\]
Thus, the number of bananas is:
\[
x - \frac{9}{12}x = \frac{3}{12}x = \frac{1}{4}x
\]

The total number of fruits must be a multiple of the least common multiple of the denominators (4, 3, and 6), which is 12. Therefore, possible values for \( x \) could be 12, 24, 36, etc.

(Mathematics) (Algebraic Expressions, Word Problem) D 6 (Multi-part)

(a) Express the sum of money he had at first in terms of \( c \).  

(b) If \( c = 6 \), find the sum of money he had at first.  

(c) If \( c = 27 \), find the sum of money he had at first.  

\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*.]
\item Let the sum of money he had at first be represented as \( x \). If he spent $13, then the remaining amount is \( c \). Therefore, the equation can be expressed as:
\[
x - 13 = c
\]
Thus, the sum of money he had at first in terms of \( c \) is:
\[
x = c + 13
\]

\item If \( c = 6 \), substituting into the equation gives:
\[
x = 6 + 13 = 19
\]

\item If \( c = 27 \), substituting into the equation gives:
\[
x = 27 + 13 = 40
\]

(Mathematics) (Word Problem) D 6 (With Answer)

Jason sold \(\frac{3}{10}\) as many pens as Mike. If Jason sold 210 fewer pens than Mike, how many pens did they sell altogether?

\subsection{Answers}
Let \( x \) be the number of pens Mike sold. Then, Jason sold \(\frac{3}{10}x\) pens. According to the problem, we have the equation:

\[
\frac{3}{10}x = x - 210
\]

Solving for \( x \):

\[
\frac{3}{10}x + 210 = x
\]
\[
210 = x - \frac{3}{10}x
\]
\[
210 = \frac{7}{10}x
\]
\[
x = 210 \times \frac{10}{7} = 300
\]

So, Mike sold 300 pens, and Jason sold:

\[
\frac{3}{10} \times 300 = 90
\]

Altogether, they sold:

\[
300 + 90 = 390 \text{ pens.}
\]

(Mathematics) (Word Problem, Ratio Problem) D 6 (With Answer)

The ratio of the number of Cynthia's posters to the number of Laura's posters was \( 3 : 4 \). Cynthia had 24 fewer posters than Laura. Later, Laura gave 36 of her posters away to her brother. Find the new ratio of the number of Cynthia's posters to the number of Laura's posters.

\subsection{Answers}
Let the number of Cynthia's posters be \( 3x \) and Laura's posters be \( 4x \). According to the problem, we have:
\[
3x = 4x - 24
\]
Solving for \( x \):
\[
x = 24
\]
Thus, Cynthia has \( 3 \times 24 = 72 \) posters and Laura has \( 4 \times 24 = 96 \) posters. After Laura gives away 36 posters, she has \( 96 - 36 = 60 \) posters. The new ratio of Cynthia's posters to Laura's posters is:
\[
\frac{72}{60} = \frac{12}{10} = \frac{6}{5}
\]
The new ratio is \( 6 : 5 \).

Sam drove from Town A to Town B. He covered \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the journey in the first hour and \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the journey in the second hour. He took \( \frac{1}{2} \) hour to cover the remaining 40 km. Find his average speed for the whole journey.

\subsection{Answers}
To find the total distance, let the total distance be \( D \). Then, we have:
\[
\frac{1}{3}D + \frac{2}{5}D + 40 = D
\]
Solving for \( D \):
\[
\frac{5}{15}D + \frac{6}{15}D + 40 = D \\
\frac{11}{15}D + 40 = D \\
40 = D - \frac{11}{15}D \\
40 = \frac{4}{15}D \\
D = 40 \times \frac{15}{4} = 150 \text{ km}
\]

Total time taken:
- First hour: 1 hour
- Second hour: 1 hour
- Last segment: \( \frac{1}{2} \) hour

Total time = \( 1 + 1 + \frac{1}{2} = 2.5 \) hours.

Average speed = \( \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} = \frac{150 \text{ km}}{2.5 \text{ hours}} = 60 \text{ km/h} \).

The average speed for the whole journey is \( 60 \text{ km/h} \).

\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*.]
\item Calculate the total distance of the journey.
\item Determine Angela's average speed for the entire journey.
\end{enumerate}

[STRDGM] A diagram showing a path from Village A to Village B, divided into three segments: the first segment representing \( \frac{3}{10} \) of the journey labeled with "30 minutes", the second segment representing \( \frac{3}{8} \) of the journey labeled with "1 hour", and the last segment representing 6.5 km labeled with "1 hour".

(Mathematics) (Word Problem, Distance and Speed Calculation) D 6 (With Answer)

A train travelled from City P to City Q. It covered \( \frac{5}{12} \) of the journey in the first 3 hours, \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the journey in the next hour, and the remaining 180 km in 2 hours. Find its average speed for the whole journey.

\subsection{Answers}
To find the total distance, we first calculate the total journey distance \( D \):
\[
\frac{5}{12}D + \frac{1}{4}D + 180 = D
\]
Converting \( \frac{1}{4}D \) to twelfths gives \( \frac{3}{12}D \):
\[
\frac{5}{12}D + \frac{3}{12}D + 180 = D
\]
\[
\frac{8}{12}D + 180 = D
\]
\[
180 = D - \frac{8}{12}D
\]
\[
180 = \frac{4}{12}D
\]
\[
D = 180 \times 3 = 540 \text{ km}
\]

Now, we calculate the total time taken:
- Time for the first segment: 3 hours
- Time for the second segment: 1 hour
- Time for the third segment: 2 hours

Total time = \( 3 + 1 + 2 = 6 \) hours.

Average speed = \( \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} = \frac{540 \text{ km}}{6 \text{ hours}} = 90 \text{ km/h} \).

Thus, the average speed for the whole journey is 90 km/h.
