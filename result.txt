(English) (Writing Exercise, Creative Writing Exercise) D 5 (With Illustration, Exercise on story continuation)

The three hobbits, Merry, Pippin, and Frodo, found themselves deep in the heart of a dark and twisted forest. The trees loomed high above them, their branches tangled like fingers clawing at the sky. Shadows flickered all around, and even the faintest sounds seemed louder, echoing eerily among the trunks.

Merry, always the cheerful one, tried to keep everyone’s spirits up. Though he was feeling uncertain, he whistled softly to himself as they walked, hoping his calmness might rub off on the others. Occasionally, he caught a glimpse of what he thought was a path, and he felt a little surge of relief every time they seemed to be going in the right direction.

But Pippin was struggling. The darkness, the strange sounds, and the constant feeling of being lost gnawed at him. At one point, he couldn’t hold back his frustration anymore. “I can’t bear it!” he shouted, breaking the silence and startling the others. It felt as though the trees were closing in on him, and he began to doubt whether they’d ever find their way out.

Frodo, leading the way, tried to stay hopeful, though doubts were creeping into his mind. Every turn looked the same, and after a while, he began to wonder if they were going in circles. “What if there’s no way through?” he murmured to himself, his voice barely audible. But he kept moving forward, hoping against hope that they would eventually find an escape.

Then, just as despair began to settle in, Merry caught sight of something up ahead—a path, winding its way through the trees and leading toward what looked like the edge of the forest. He let out a low whistle of relief, and Frodo and Pippin quickly followed his gaze. Could this be their way out?

You are going to write the next part of the story. What do you think the characters do, say and feel when they find their way out of the forest?

\begin{enumerate}
\item Merry
In the forest Merry seemed fairly cheerful and whistled with relief when he saw the path.
Do you think Merry was more or less worried than the others?
When they find their way out, what do you think Merry:
\begin{enumerate}
\item does?
\item thinks?
\item feels?
\end{enumerate}

\item Pippin
In the forest Pippin 'could not bear it any longer' and 'let out a shout'.
Do you think Pippin was more or less worried than the others?
When they find their way out, what do you think Pippin:
\begin{enumerate}
\item does?
\item thinks?
\item feels?
\end{enumerate}

\item Frodo
In the forest Frodo began to wonder if it were possible to find a way through.
Do you think he was more or less worried than the others?
When they find their way out, what do you think Frodo:
\begin{enumerate}
\item does?
\item thinks?
\item feels?
\end{enumerate}

\item Use your notes to write the next part of the story in your exercise book.
