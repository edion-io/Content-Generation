Dieser Mann war sehr arm, aber er besa\u00df ein Pferd, das so exquisit war, das selbst K\u00f6nige es ihm abkaufen wollten-  und das zu jedem Preis. Doch der Mann lehnte immer wieder ab. Pl\u00f6tzlich eines Morgens, stellte er fest, dass das Pferd verschwunden war. Alle Menschen aus dem Dorf versammelten um ihr Mitgef\u00fchl auszudr\u00fccken.\\\\\n\nSie sagten: \"Oh, was f\u00fcr ein Ungl\u00fcck, was h\u00e4ttest du f\u00fcr ein Verm\u00f6gen mit diesem Pferd verdienen k\u00f6nnen und man hat dir so viel daf\u00fcr geboten! Aber du warst zu dickk\u00f6pfig und zu dumm. Jetzt ist das Pferd weg. \"\\\\\n\nAber der alte Mann lachte nur und sagte: \"Ach redet doch keinen Unsinn: \"Alles was man dar\u00fcber sagen kann, ist, dass das Pferd jetzt nicht mehr in seinem Stall ist. Lass die Zukunft kommen und uns zeigen was passiert\"\\\\\n\nNach wenigen Tagen kehrte das Pferd pl\u00f6tzlich zur\u00fcck in seinen Stall. Nicht nur das, es brachte eine ganze Herde wilder Pferde aus dem Wald mit. Und wieder versammelte sich das ganze Dorf und sie sagten: \"Unglaublich, der alte Mann hatte Recht sein Pferd ist tats\u00e4chlich zur\u00fcckgekommen, und es hat auch noch ein ganzes dutzend toller Pferde mitgebracht. Jetzt kann er so viel Geld verdienen, wie er will.\" Und sie gingen zu dem alten Mann und sagten: \"Oh es tut uns Leid wir konnten das ja nicht voraussehen und die Wege Gottes verstehen, aber du bist unglaublich. Du hast es wohl irgendwie geahnt. Vielleicht kannst du sogar die Zukunft voraussehen.\"\\\\\n\n\"So ein Quatsch.\" sagte der alte Mann nur. \"Ich wei\u00df nur, eins: N\u00e4mlich, dass das Pferd mit einer ganzen Herde Pferde zur\u00fcckgekommen ist und was morgen geschehen wird, das wei\u00df nur der liebe Gott.\"\\\\\n\nUnd schon ein paar Tage sp\u00e4ter geschah es, das der einzige Sohn des Mannes, der die neuen Pferde zureiten wollte, dabei vom Pferd fiel. Er brach sich dabei seine Beine so schwer, das er fortan wohl nicht mehr w\u00fcrde richtig laufen k\u00f6nnen. Die Menschen kamen wieder zu dem alten Mann und sagten: \"Du hast recht gehabt. Man wei\u00df nie. Die Sache mit den Pferden hat sich als ein Fluch erwiesen. Da w\u00e4re es besser gewesen, w\u00e4ren die Pferde \u00fcberhaupt gar nicht erst gekommen. Nun wird dein Sohn f\u00fcr sein ganzes Leben lang verkr\u00fcppelt sein.\\\\\n\nAber der alte Mann sagte wieder nur: \"Nicht so voreilig. Wartet ab! Man wird sehen was geschieht. Man kann n\u00e4mlich nur eines dar\u00fcber sagen, n\u00e4mlich, dass mein Sohn sich die Beine gebrochen hat. Das ist alles.\"\\\\\n\nEinige Wochen sp\u00e4ter ergab es sich das in dem Land ein Krieg ausbrach und alle die jungen M\u00e4nner des Dorfes von der Regierung zwangsweise eingezogen wurden. Nur der Sohn des alten Mannes durfte zu Hause bleiben, weil er f\u00fcr den Krieg untauglich war.\\\\\n\nUnd wieder versammelten sich alle Menschen des Dorfes und klagten: \"Unsere S\u00f6hne sind fort und du hast wenigstens noch deinen Sohn. Er mag zwar seine Beine gebrochen haben, aber er ist bei dir. Unsere S\u00f6hne sind fort und der Feind ist vielleicht viel m\u00e4chtiger. Wahrscheinlich werden sie alle sterben. Jetzt werden wir niemanden haben, der sich im Alter um uns k\u00fcmmert. Aber du hast ja noch deinen Sohn. Er wird bestimmt wieder gesund.\\\\\n\nDoch der alte Mann sagte wieder nur: \"Man kann dar\u00fcber nur eins sagen: Eure S\u00f6hne wurden eingezogen. Mein Sohn ist hier geblieben.

This man was very poor, but he owned a horse so exquisite that even kings wanted to buy it from him\u2014at any price. Yet, the man repeatedly refused. One morning, he suddenly discovered that the horse was gone. All the villagers gathered to express their sympathy.\\\\\n\nThey said: \u201cOh, what bad luck! You could have earned a fortune with that horse, and so many had offered you so much for it! But you were too stubborn and too foolish. Now the horse is gone.\u201d\\\\\n\nBut the old man just laughed and said: \u201cOh, stop talking nonsense. All that can be said about this is that the horse is no longer in its stable. Let the future come and show us what will happen.\u201d\\\\\n\nA few days later, the horse suddenly returned to its stable. Not only that, but it brought with it an entire herd of wild horses from the forest. Once again, the whole village gathered, and they said: \u201cUnbelievable! The old man was right\u2014his horse actually came back, and it even brought a dozen fine horses with it. Now he can earn as much money as he wants.\u201d They went to the old man and said: \u201cOh, we are sorry; we could not foresee this or understand God\u2019s ways. But you are incredible. You must have had some inkling. Maybe you can even see the future.\u201d\\\\\n\n\u201cNonsense,\u201d said the old man. \u201cI only know one thing: the horse came back with a whole herd of horses. What will happen tomorrow is known only to God.\u201d\\\\\n\nAnd just a few days later, it happened that the man\u2019s only son, who was trying to tame the new horses, fell off one of them. He broke his legs so badly that he would likely never be able to walk properly again. The people came to the old man once more and said: \u201cYou were right. One never knows. This business with the horses turned out to be a curse. It would have been better if the horses had never come at all. Now your son will be crippled for the rest of his life.\u201d\\\\\n\nBut the old man again said: \u201cDon\u2019t be so quick to judge. Wait and see! All that can be said is that my son broke his legs. That\u2019s all.\u201d\\\\\n\nA few weeks later, a war broke out in the land, and all the young men of the village were forcibly conscripted by the government. Only the old man\u2019s son was allowed to stay home because he was unfit for war.\\\\\n\nOnce again, all the villagers gathered and lamented: \u201cOur sons are gone, but at least you still have your son. He may have broken his legs, but he is here with you. Our sons are gone, and the enemy may be far more powerful. They will probably all die. Now we will have no one to care for us in our old age. But you still have your son. He will surely recover.\u201d\\\\\n\nBut the old man once again said: \u201cThere is only one thing that can be said: your sons were conscripted. My son stayed here. That\u2019s all. Nothing follows from this.\u201d\\\\\n\n\\subsection*{Answers}\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item Der Mann hatte ein Pferd.\n\\item Mit seinem Sohn.\n\\item Die Bewohner aus dem Dorf.\n\\item Das Pferd kam wieder mit einem Dutzend anderer Pferde.\n\\item Der Sohn des Mannes fiel vom Pferd.\n\\item 2\n\\item 3\n\\item 2\n\\item 3\n\\item 2\n\\end{enumerate}"

Elle commen\u00e7a \u00e0 ranger ses affaires lorsqu'elle entendit frapper \u00e0 sa porte. Elle vit qu'il s'agissait de sa m\u00e8re, qui entra apr\u00e8s avoir re\u00e7u sa permission.\\\\\n\n-- Salut, ma ch\u00e9rie. Que fais-tu ? dit Maman avec un tendre sourire.\\\\\n\n-- Salut ! r\u00e9pondit la fillette en haussant les \u00e9paules. Rien du tout. Je viens de finir mes devoirs, et maintenant je n'ai plus rien \u00e0 faire.\\\\\n\n-- C'est tr\u00e8s bien, ma puce, la louangea Maman. Et \u00e7a tombe bien que tu n'aies plus rien \u00e0 faire, parce que j'ai quelque chose pour toi.\\\\\n\nMagali s'assit sur sa chaise de bureau, attendant que Maman lui r\u00e9v\u00e8le ce qu'elle lui avait apport\u00e9. Celle-ci sortit un livre cach\u00e9 derri\u00e8re son dos et le lui tendit.\\\\\n\n-- C'est un livre de coloriage et un conte de f\u00e9es en m\u00eame temps, dit Maman avant de s'installer \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 de Magali, qui ouvrait le livre.\\\\\n\n-- Tu vois, l\u00e0. Elle lui montra une image du doigt. C'est l'illustration de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence. Tu dois colorier le dessin avec les m\u00eames couleurs que celles qui y sont. Et dans cette partie, dit-elle en lui montrant l'autre page, se trouve l'histoire.\\\\\n\nApr\u00e8s son explication et apr\u00e8s que sa fille l'eut remerci\u00e9e, Maman quitta la chambre. Magali lut l'histoire et conclut que c'\u00e9tait un conte de f\u00e9es typique : une princesse n'avait pour compagnie que son chien et s'ennuyait dans son palais. Sa marraine, la bonne f\u00e9e, lui jeta un sort et transforma ses v\u00eatements pour qu'elle ressemble \u00e0 une villageoise. Cela lui permit de s'aventurer dans le village, o\u00f9 elle rencontra un prince qui, lui aussi, se d\u00e9guisait pour explorer les royaumes voisins.\\\\\n\nElle trouva que c'\u00e9tait une sorte de Cendrillon \u00e0 l'envers et ne fut pas vraiment impressionn\u00e9e ; elle passa donc au coloriage. Mais, apr\u00e8s deux dessins, elle jugea les illustrations peu int\u00e9ressantes et d\u00e9cida de prendre les choses en main. Elle allait changer l'histoire et adapter les dessins \u00e0 sa propre version du r\u00e9cit. Elle retourna aux pages pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes et commen\u00e7a \u00e0 r\u00eavasser.\\\\\n\nElle changea la couleur de la robe de la princesse, passant du rose au noir avec des traits verts. Dans sa t\u00eate, la princesse \u00e9tait devenue l'ambassadrice d'une autre plan\u00e8te. Elle dessina un trait rouge qui s'\u00e9tendait de la baguette magique de la marraine \u00e0 la robe : c'\u00e9tait un rayon laser. La marraine \u00e9tait devenue vilaine et avait vol\u00e9 les v\u00eatements de l'ambassadrice pour l'emp\u00eacher de retourner sur sa plan\u00e8te, car ses v\u00eatements lui permettaient de se t\u00e9l\u00e9porter.\\\\\n\nMagali bascula dans son monde imaginaire, o\u00f9 elle devint C\u00e9lestine, l'ambassadrice interstellaire. Apr\u00e8s avoir perdu ses v\u00eatements, C\u00e9lestine alla retrouver son gardien. Ce dernier avait pris l'apparence d'un chien, mais c'\u00e9tait en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 un extraterrestre humano\u00efde, comme elle.\\\\\n\n-- \u00c9on ! cria-t-elle. On doit partir d'ici imm\u00e9diatement ! Ce palais n'est plus s\u00fbr. J'ai d\u00e9couvert que les humains complotent pour envahir notre plan\u00e8te, et l'une d'eux m'a pris mon uniforme lorsqu'elle m'a rep\u00e9r\u00e9e.\\\\\n\n-- Je n'en crois pas mes oreilles, Dame C\u00e9lestine ! r\u00e9pondit le chien avec horreur. Je vais contacter notre base a\u00e9rienne pour les pr\u00e9venir de notre arriv\u00e9e !\\\\\n\nIl se dirigea vers le miroir de la coiffeuse dans la chambre de l'ambassadrice et toucha la glace. Apr\u00e8s quelques gestes, il se retrouva face \u00e0 une personne de son esp\u00e8ce et lui expliqua bri\u00e8vement ce qui s'\u00e9tait pass\u00e9, avant d'informer qu'ils allaient rentrer plus t\u00f4t que pr\u00e9vu.\\\\\n\n-- Nous devons nous rendre au village imm\u00e9diatement, c'est l\u00e0 o\u00f9 j'ai plant\u00e9 la capsule d'urgence, dit-il \u00e0 C\u00e9lestine.\\\\\n\n-- Allons-y !\\\\\n\nLes deux s'\u00e9chapp\u00e8rent furtivement du palais et coururent vers le village. Une fois arriv\u00e9s, ils ralentirent pour ne pas \u00e9veiller les soup\u00e7ons des humains.\\\\\n\n-- La capsule se trouve au fond du puits, dit \u00c9on. C'est l\u00e0 que nous devons aller.\\\\\n\nIls se rendirent au centre du village, et \u00c9on reprit son apparence humaine. Lui et la princesse firent semblant de se rencontrer et d'\u00e9changer quelques mots pendant qu'il sortait discr\u00e8tement la capsule du puits. Ils \u00e9taient sauv\u00e9s ! Ils mont\u00e8rent \u00e0 bord et quitt\u00e8rent la Terre pour informer leur peuple des manigances humaines.\\\\\n\nMagali sortit de son monde imaginaire et prit soin d'effacer le chien des images o\u00f9 le prince \u00e9tait pr\u00e9sent ; dans sa version, c'\u00e9tait la m\u00eame personne. Elle modifia \u00e9galement la tenue et dessina la capsule spatiale. Elle tourna les pages du livre et admira fi\u00e8rement son \u0153uvre. Les dessins \u00e9taient d\u00e9sormais plus excitants, pleins de couleurs vives, de noir et de gris pour les v\u00eatements des extraterrestres et la capsule.\\\\\n\nMaman revint avec un plateau contenant son go\u00fbter, pr\u00eate \u00e0 lui demander si elle avait aim\u00e9 le livre, mais elle s'arr\u00eata en voyant les coloriages.\\\\\n\n-- Pourquoi ne t'es-tu pas bas\u00e9e sur les images de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence, ma ch\u00e9rie ? demanda-t-elle.\\\\\n\n-- Parce que je n'ai pas trop aim\u00e9 l'histoire, r\u00e9pondit Magali.

        "response": "Maman ferma le livre d'histoire, le posa sur la table de chevet d'Angela et s'approcha d'elle pour lui embrasser le front.\\\\\n\n-- Bonne nuit ma ch\u00e9rie, dit-elle en la couvrant avec sa couette.\\\\\n\nAngela lui souhaita bonne nuit et la regarda \u00e9teindre la lumi\u00e8re avant de sortir en laissant la porte entre-ouverte. Elle leva la t\u00eate et se mit \u00e0 admirer les \u00e9toiles lumineuses projet\u00e9es par sa lampe, d\u00e9filant lentement sur le plafond de sa chambre. En les regardant, Angela se rappela d'un d\u00e9tail tir\u00e9 de l'histoire de cette nuit : un vieux nain avait dit au prince qu'un arc-en-ciel \u00e9tait en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 un pont, un portail en quelque sorte, qui conduisait \u00e0 un univers merveilleux o\u00f9 on pouvait trouver tout ce que l'on d\u00e9sire. Un monde fantastique de magie, de beaut\u00e9 et d'aventures.\\\\\n\nCette partie de l'histoire l'avait int\u00e9ress\u00e9e bien plus que le reste, et elle se demanda dans quel genre de monde elle atterrirait si elle venait un jour \u00e0 croiser un arc-en-ciel. Y aurait-il des dragons ? Des f\u00e9es ? Des sir\u00e8nes ? Angela r\u00eavassa un peu sur ce sujet avant de s'endormir avec un sourire r\u00eaveur.\\\\\n\nLe matin, r\u00e9veill\u00e9e par son alarme bruyante, elle se rappela de ses r\u00eaves d'aventure. Elle aurait tellement aim\u00e9 explorer de nouveaux mondes plut\u00f4t que d'aller en classe. Elle fit un v\u0153u de voir un arc-en-ciel, sortit de son lit et alla se pr\u00e9parer. Une fois pr\u00eate, elle salua ses parents, prit son petit-d\u00e9jeuner, et se rendit \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole. Sa journ\u00e9e \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s ordinaire, sans \u00e9v\u00e9nements particuliers. Elle suivit ses cours, joua avec ses amis \u00e0 la r\u00e9cr\u00e9ation, et prit son d\u00e9jeuner \u00e0 la cantine.\\\\\n\n\u00c0 l'heure de rentrer, il se mit \u00e0 pleuvoir, et Angela dut attendre car elle n'avait pas pris de parapluie. Surprise, elle se dit que c'\u00e9tait \u00e9trange pour une journ\u00e9e annonc\u00e9e ensoleill\u00e9e. Finalement, lorsque la pluie cessa, elle se mit en route pour chez elle. En \u00e9vitant les flaques d'eau, elle aper\u00e7ut le reflet de quelque chose de color\u00e9 dans l'une d'elles. Elle leva la t\u00eate et vit un arc-en-ciel. Ses yeux s'agrandirent d'\u00e9merveillement en se rappelant de ce qu'elle avait imagin\u00e9 la veille au soir.\\\\\n\nAngela regarda autour d'elle, mais il n'y avait personne pour partager sa joie. Elle soupira, se disant qu'il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 merveilleux de pouvoir traverser l'arc-en-ciel pour se retrouver dans un autre monde. Distraitement, elle traversa la flaque d'eau et se sentit soudain pouss\u00e9e par un vent violent qui la fit tomber.\\\\\n\n-- Ouille ! s'\u00e9cria-t-elle.\\\\\n\nElle ouvrit les yeux, mais resta allong\u00e9e sur le sol, qui ne lui parut pas aussi dur qu'elle l'aurait cru. La premi\u00e8re chose qu'elle vit \u00e9tait un ciel bleu clair qui passait graduellement \u00e0 un rose pastel. Fron\u00e7ant les sourcils, elle r\u00e9alisa que le ciel \u00e9tait diff\u00e9rent d'il y a deux minutes ! Elle aper\u00e7ut trois grands cercles blancs presque transparents et entendit le bruissement des feuilles, le chant des oiseaux, et le doux ruissellement de l'eau. Elle se releva et d\u00e9couvrit avec stup\u00e9faction qu'elle se trouvait dans une grande plaine couverte de fleurs et d'arbres, baignant dans des senteurs d'herbe et de fleurs qu'elle n'avait jamais rencontr\u00e9es.\\\\\n\nElle remarqua qu'elle voyait, sentait et entendait tout avec une intensit\u00e9 d\u00e9cupl\u00e9e. Quand elle se pencha sur une petite rivi\u00e8re pour boire, elle vit son reflet : ses cheveux avaient des reflets arc-en-ciel, et ses yeux verts brillaient d'un \u00e9clat vif. Ses v\u00eatements avaient chang\u00e9 \u00e9galement, et elle portait une tunique bleue fonc\u00e9e, un pantalon blanc et des bottes marron.\\\\\n\nElle n'eut pas le temps de boire car son attention fut captur\u00e9e par le reflet d'un dragon de feu volant au-dessus d'elle. Elle se tourna pour voir la cr\u00e9ature et sentit sa chaleur passer dans l'air avec gr\u00e2ce.\\\\\n\n-- Mais o\u00f9 suis-je ? murmura-t-elle, bouche b\u00e9e.\\\\\n\n-- Eh bien, \u00e0 Galazio, \u00e9videmment ! r\u00e9pondit une voix joviale.\\\\\n\nAngela sursauta, cherchant autour d'elle l'origine de cette voix.\\\\\n\n-- Je suis l\u00e0, un peu plus bas ! dit la voix.\\\\\n\nElle baissa les yeux et aper\u00e7ut une minuscule femme assise sur le p\u00e9tale d'un coquelicot. Bien qu'elle la voyait bien, Angela s'agenouilla pour observer de plus pr\u00e8s.\\\\\n\n-- Ne viens pas trop pr\u00e8s, ou je vais attraper froid avec tes expirations ! rit la petite femme.\\\\\n\n-- Vous\u2026 \u00eates une f\u00e9e ? demanda Angela en s'\u00e9loignant.\\\\\n\n-- Exactement !\\\\\n\nAngela se pr\u00e9senta et la f\u00e9e se nomma Emmeline, ou Em pour les intimes. Elles discut\u00e8rent, et Angela demanda s'il y avait d'autres cr\u00e9atures magiques sur Galazio. Em lui parla des dragons, des elfes, des licornes et m\u00eame d'humains comme elle. Curieuse, Angela demanda si elle \u00e9tait cens\u00e9e combattre des cr\u00e9atures mal\u00e9fiques, mais Em la rassura : Galazio \u00e9tait une plan\u00e8te paisible.\\\\\n\n-- Peut-\u00eatre que tu peux aller explorer des terres lointaines ? proposa Angela.\\\\\n\n-- Je\u2026 ne pense pas. Cette plan\u00e8te est minuscule, r\u00e9pondit Em avec un sourire amus\u00e9. Mais tu peux aller \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole !\\\\\n\nAngela soupira.\\\\\n\n-- Quand puis-je rentrer chez moi ? demanda-t-elle.\\\\\n\nEm lui expliqua que les arcs-en-ciel, servant de portail, n'apparaissent qu'une fois tous les quinze jours. D\u00e9\u00e7ue, Angela soupira. Em, cherchant \u00e0 lui remonter le moral, lui proposa de faire le tour de Galazio et de se faire des amis en attendant.\\\\\n\nAngela rencontra les dragons aux couleurs flamboyantes, les licornes aux crini\u00e8res color\u00e9es, et les autres habitants de Galazio, tous bienveillants. Elle fut invit\u00e9e \u00e0 un grand d\u00eener o\u00f9 elle d\u00e9couvrit que tout avait un go\u00fbt plus prononc\u00e9 ici. Elle dansa avec les enfants de Galazio, mais se sentit soudain triste en voyant les autres rentrer avec leurs parents.\\\\\n\n-- Allez, viens ! Madame Maeva t'a pr\u00e9par\u00e9 une chambre. Au lit ! dit Em.\\\\\n\nUne fois dans son lit, Angela fixa le plafond, regrettant de ne pas y voir les \u00e9toiles de sa chambre. Elle se surprit \u00e0 souhaiter se r\u00e9veiller chez elle. Le lendemain, elle ouvrit les yeux et poussa un soupir en se voyant encore \u00e0 Galazio. Elle rejoignit Em dans le jardin, mais un dragon de feu passa rapidement devant elle, et elle tr\u00e9bucha.\\\\\n\n-- Attention ! cria la jeune f\u00e9e.\\\\\n\nAngela entendit la voix de Mme Rolland, son institutrice, et ouvrit soudain les yeux pour d\u00e9couvrir qu'elle \u00e9tait dans sa classe.\\\\\n\n-- Je suis de retour, chuchota-t-elle, regardant ses v\u00eatements d'uniforme. Quand la cloche sonna, elle courut chez elle et embrassa ses parents.\\\\\n\nIl est vrai qu'il n'y avait ni dragons ni f\u00e9es ici, mais elle \u00e9tait chez elle, et c'\u00e9tait tout ce qui comptait.\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item Qui est-ce qui avait dit au prince qu'un arc-en-ciel est un portail vers d'autres mondes ?\n    \\begin{enumerate}\n        \\item[A.] Un elf\n        \\item[B.] Une f\u00e9e\n        \\item[C.] Un nain\n        \\item[D.] Une licorne\n    \\end{enumerate}\n\n    \\item Comment Angela \u00e9tait-elle arriv\u00e9e \u00e0 Galazio ?\n    \\begin{enumerate}\n        \\item[A.] En croisant une flaque d'eau\n        \\item[B.] En croisant un arc-en-ciel\n        \\item[C.] En croisant une cascade\n        \\item[D.] En croisant un pont\n    \\end{enumerate}\n\n    \\item Comment s'appelait la f\u00e9e qu'Angela rencontra \u00e0 Galazio ?\n    \\begin{enumerate}\n        \\item[A.] Emmeline\n        \\item[B.] Eveline\n        \\item[C.] Evangeline\n        \\item[D.] Eline\n    \\end{enumerate}\n\n    \\item O\u00f9 est-ce qu'Angela avait pass\u00e9 la nuit ?\n    \\begin{enumerate}\n        \\item[A.] Chez Mme Maelle\n        \\item[B.] Chez Mme Rolland\n        \\item[C.] Chez Mme Maeva\n        \\item[D.] Chez Mme Adline\n    \\end{enumerate}\n\n    \\item Qui est-ce qui avait pouss\u00e9 Angela avant son retour sur terre ?\n    \\begin{enumerate}\n        \\item[A.] Une F\u00e9e\n        \\item[B.] Une Sir\u00e8ne\n        \\item[C.] Une Licorne\n        \\item[D.] Un Dragon\n    \\end{enumerate}\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\\subsection*{Answers}\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item C\n    \\item A\n    \\item A\n    \\item C\n    \\item D\n\\end{enumerate}"

        "response": "Toby \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s excit\u00e9 d'accompagner son p\u00e8re dehors. Les deux allaient au march\u00e9 pour acheter des l\u00e9gumes puis au supermarch\u00e9 pour faire les courses. Malgr\u00e9 que ces t\u00e2ches n'avaient rien d'excitant, le petit gar\u00e7on \u00e9tait heureux. C'\u00e9tait la premi\u00e8re fois o\u00f9 il sortait pour faire ce genre de shopping, d'habitude il sortait avec ses parents pour acheter des v\u00eatements ou des jouets mais jamais pour acheter de la nourriture. Il se demanda si son p\u00e8re lui permettrait d'acheter beaucoup de g\u00e2teries...\n\nUne fois qu'ils arriv\u00e8rent au march\u00e9, le petit gar\u00e7on sauta pratiquement hors de la voiture avant que son p\u00e8re ne put quitter son si\u00e8ge. Toby courut en avant et en se rappelant de son p\u00e8re, il s'arr\u00eata brusquement. Il se retourna et regarda son p\u00e8re fermer la voiture avant de se tourner pour le regarder.\n\n\\textit{-Ne cours pas, mon grand. Tu risques de tomber et de te faire mal!} Son p\u00e8re marcha vers lui et prit sa main. \\textit{Et ensuite, on va se faire gronder.} Il fit un clin d'\u0153il \u00e0 son fils avec un sourire. Toby rigola joyeusement. Le prospect de se faire gronder avec son p\u00e8re le rendit heureux et il pensa que cela le rendrait plus proche de son p\u00e8re. Comme des camarades qui auraient d\u00e9sob\u00e9i aux ordres et qui se feraient r\u00e9primander par leur sup\u00e9rieur. Mais, sa m\u00e8re \u00e9tait plus belle qu'un sup\u00e9rieur en arm\u00e9e, bien \u00e9videmment!\n\nLe petit gar\u00e7on \u00e9tait plein d'enthousiasme en voyant les tables pleines de fruits et l\u00e9gumes color\u00e9s. Des tomates rouges vif, des cerises et des poivrons. Des pommes vertes, des brocolis, des asperges. Des oranges, des citrouilles, des aubergines, des myrtilles, des pommes de terre et des melons. Il y avait tous les l\u00e9gumes qu'il connaissait et m\u00eame certains qu'il ne connaissait pas.\n\nCertaines parties du march\u00e9 \u00e9taient m\u00eame d\u00e9di\u00e9es aux poissons, \u00e9pices, haricots et herbes. Lui et son p\u00e8re firent leur chemin \u00e0 travers cet endroit en achetant ce qui \u00e9tait marqu\u00e9 dans leur liste de courses puis retourn\u00e8rent \u00e0 la voiture et mirent leurs sacs de l\u00e9gumes dans la malle.\n\nLe supermarch\u00e9 \u00e9tait beaucoup moins excitant. Les produits \u00e9taient simplement pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s sur des \u00e9tag\u00e8res dans de diff\u00e9rentes all\u00e9es. Il n'y avait pas de tables avec des vendeurs qui bavardaient et riaient avec les clients mais il y avait quelques employ\u00e9s qui offraient des \u00e9chantillons de d\u00e9gustation de tartelettes et de sauces au fromage et d'autres produits du genre.\n\nToby \u00e9tait content d'y \u00eatre cependant, car son p\u00e8re lui avait permis de choisir la marque des c\u00e9r\u00e9ales et lui avait m\u00eame achet\u00e9 une barre de chocolat comme r\u00e9compense pour \u00eatre rest\u00e9 sage. Quand ils retourn\u00e8rent \u00e0 la maison, ils pass\u00e8rent par une vente de garage que leur voisin tenait et encore une fois, Toby \u00e9tait intrigu\u00e9 par les gens qui s'\u00e9taient rassembl\u00e9s autour des tables sur lesquelles diff\u00e9rents objets \u00e9taient pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s.\n\nQuand son p\u00e8re expliqua qu'une vente de garage \u00e9tait un moyen de se faire un peu d'argent et de se d\u00e9barrasser des objets dont on n'a plus besoin, le petit gar\u00e7on eut une id\u00e9e. L'apr\u00e8s-midi, quand Toby rencontra ses amis dehors, il leur parla de son id\u00e9e.\n\n\\textit{-On devrait tenir un march\u00e9. On peut vendre des g\u00e2teries que nos mamans pr\u00e9pareraient ou des objets que l'on n'utilise plus.}\n\n\\textit{-Quels types d'objets?} Un de ses amis lui demanda.\n\n\\textit{-Des jouets. Des livres de coloriage. N'importe quel objet que tu n'utilises plus.} Il expliqua.\n\n\\textit{-Qui les ach\u00e8terait? Je ne crois pas que les adultes voudront des jouets et les enfants n'ont pas beaucoup d'argent. Certains n'ont m\u00eame pas d'argent de poche.} Une autre amie lui dit.\n\n\\textit{-On peut simplement faire des \u00e9changes. Si l'un de vous aime quelque chose que l'autre vend, il peut \u00e9changer avec lui un autre objet.} Toby dit ayant d\u00e9j\u00e0 pens\u00e9 au manque d'argent.\n\n\\textit{-Les adultes n'ach\u00e8teront peut-\u00eatre pas de jouets mais ils ach\u00e8teront des biscuits et du jus. Mon grand fr\u00e8re vendait de la limonade l'\u00e9t\u00e9 dernier et il s'est fait assez d'argent pour acheter un nouveau t\u00e9l\u00e9phone.}\n\n\\textit{-Je pense que c'est une bonne id\u00e9e. J'ai toujours voulu avoir un magasin de bouquins quand je serais grand et maintenant je peux commencer \u00e0 m'entra\u00eener.} Un autre enfant dit. Les autres enfants bavard\u00e8rent avec enthousiasme et ils \u00e9taient tous excit\u00e9s par leur petit projet.\n\n\\textit{-On doit demander la permission des adultes, par contre.} Toby dit. \\textit{Et pas que nos parents, on doit voir si les voisins n'auront pas d'inconv\u00e9nients.}\n\n\\textit{-Qu'est-ce qu'on va faire avec l'argent?} On lui demanda par la suite. Toby n'y avait pas pens\u00e9. Il \u00e9tait vrai qu'ils n'avaient besoin de rien puisque leurs parents prenaient soin de leur acheter tout ce dont ils avaient besoin et il pensa que leurs parents n'approuveraient pas qu'ils utilisent l'argent pour s'acheter des bonbons ou des jeux. Il savait que les adultes leur disaient toujours de ne pas gaspiller l'argent.\n\n\\textit{-On pourrait en faire un don aux enfants malades dans les h\u00f4pitaux.} L'un des gar\u00e7ons dit en haussant les \u00e9paules. \\textit{N'est-ce pas ce que les scouts font quand ils vendent leurs biscuits? Ils font des dons et ils utilisent l'argent pour leurs programmes d'\u00e9cole, pas vrai?} Les enfants se mirent tous d'accord sur ce point et ils pens\u00e8rent tous que \u00e7a allait les aider pour convaincre leurs parents et le reste du quartier.\n\nLes enfants se mirent d'accord et demand\u00e8rent la permission \u00e0 leurs parents quand ils rentr\u00e8rent chez eux. Le jour suivant, ils se divis\u00e8rent et rendirent visite \u00e0 leurs voisins pour demander leur permission pour \u00e9tablir leur petit march\u00e9 de quartier et personne ne protesta. Certains offrirent m\u00eame de pr\u00e9parer des g\u00e2teries pour qu'ils les vendent.\n\n\\textit{-Mme. Jordan fait le meilleur pain aux bananes! \u00c7a va se vendre en un rien de temps.} Toby dit avec un grand sourire. Les enfants rassembl\u00e8rent les objets dont ils n'avaient plus besoin: des livres d'histoires, des livres de coloriage, des jouets, des affaires scolaires et m\u00eame des v\u00eatements. Certains avaient demand\u00e9 \u00e0 leurs parents de leur faire des g\u00e2teaux et certains pr\u00e9par\u00e8rent du jus tandis que d'autres pr\u00e9par\u00e8rent simplement des sandwiches et les voisins comme Mme. Jordan particip\u00e8rent \u00e9galement en pr\u00e9parant de la nourriture ou en leur donnant des tables et des parasols pour le march\u00e9.\n\nLe march\u00e9 n'\u00e9tait pas trop large, juste trois tables qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 install\u00e9es dans l'aire de jeux du quartier et les enfants en \u00e9taient en charge. Toby \u00e9changea sa voiture t\u00e9l\u00e9command\u00e9e contre un beau T-shirt et l'une des filles acheta ses feutres en couleur. Les enfants qui vendaient de la nourriture offrirent des \u00e9chantillons de d\u00e9gustations et les adultes achet\u00e8rent du jus et des g\u00e2teaux pour eux et leurs enfants et tout le monde s'amusa. \u00c0 la fin de la journ\u00e9e, l'argent qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 gagn\u00e9 fut compt\u00e9 et mit dans une grande enveloppe qui avait les noms de tous les enfants qui avaient organis\u00e9 la vente \u00e9crits sur elle et ils l'envoy\u00e8rent au programme de charit\u00e9 pour enfants de l'h\u00f4pital.\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item Quel est le nom du personnage principal ?\n    \\begin{enumerate}\n        \\item[A.] Tommy\n        \\item[B.] Toby\n        \\item[C.] Trudy\n        \\item[D.] Timmy\n    \\end{enumerate}\n\n    \\item O\u00f9 allait-il au d\u00e9but de l'histoire ?\n    \\begin{enumerate}\n        \\item[A.] Au march\u00e9\n        \\item[B.] \u00c0 l'aire de jeux\n        \\item[C.] Au zoo\n        \\item[D.] \u00c0 la cr\u00e8che\n    \\end{enumerate}\n\n    \\item Qui \u00e9tait avec lui ?\n    \\begin{enumerate}\n        \\item[A.] Son p\u00e8re\n        \\item[B.] Sa m\u00e8re\n        \\item[C.] Sa s\u0153ur\n        \\item[D.] Son fr\u00e8re\n    \\end{enumerate}\n\n    \\item Lequel de ces l\u00e9gumes n'appara\u00eet pas dans le texte ?\n    \\begin{enumerate}\n        \\item[A.] Les pommes de terre\n        \\item[B.] Les asperges\n        \\item[C.] Les poivrons\n        \\item[D.] Les artichauts\n    \\end{enumerate}\n\n    \\item Quelle est la fameuse p\u00e2tisserie de Mme.

Excusez-moi, mais quel est votre nom ?\\\\\n\n-- Samuel, dit le valet avec un regard curieux. Je crois que vous feriez mieux de vous recoucher, messire. Vous n'\u00eates clairement pas dans votre assiette.\\\\\n\nAlexandre refusa mais lui dit qu'il pr\u00e9f\u00e9rerait s'habiller lui-m\u00eame et lui demanda de sortir de la pi\u00e8ce. Une fois pr\u00e9sentable, Alexandre sortit de sa chambre. Samuel l'attendait au bout du corridor et s'inclina devant lui avant de lui dire qu'il allait le conduire \u00e0 la salle \u00e0 manger pour le petit d\u00e9jeuner. Samuel ajouta qu'ils partiraient ensuite au village pour r\u00e9cup\u00e9rer sa nouvelle \u00e9p\u00e9e chez le forgeron, et Alexandre acquies\u00e7a avec incertitude.\\\\\n\nAu salon, il rencontra trois hommes qui se lev\u00e8rent \u00e0 son entr\u00e9e puis le salu\u00e8rent. Samuel lui murmura qu'ils \u00e9taient ses chevaliers. Surpris par l'information, Alexandre se demanda qui il \u00e9tait dans cet univers pour vivre dans un ch\u00e2teau, avoir un valet, une \u00e9p\u00e9e et des chevaliers. Sa question trouva r\u00e9ponse lorsqu'une des dames de cour entra et s'adressa \u00e0 lui.\\\\\n\n-- Messire, son altesse votre m\u00e8re vous informe qu'elle arrivera de son voyage \u00e0 temps pour le d\u00e9jeuner.\\\\\n\nSon altesse sa m\u00e8re\u2026 il \u00e9tait donc un prince. Il tourna vers Samuel pour confirmer son hypoth\u00e8se, et d'une voix basse, celui-ci lui dit :\\\\\n\n-- Pas seulement un prince, messire. Vous \u00eates le gardien du royaume du damier.\\\\\n\nGardien du royaume du damier\u2026 Alexandre comprit que le nom du royaume venait de ses plaines, mais que voulait Samuel dire par \u201cgardien\u201d ? De quoi \u00e9tait-il cens\u00e9 garder le royaume ? Samuel interrompit ses pens\u00e9es et lui dit qu'il \u00e9tait temps de partir pour le village. Ensemble, les deux se dirig\u00e8rent vers les \u00e9curies.\\\\\n\nAu d\u00e9but, l'id\u00e9e de monter sur un cheval rendit Alexandre anxieux. Il n'avait jamais fait quelque chose de pareil et passa quelques moments \u00e0 penser \u00e0 une bonne excuse pour \u00e9viter l'engagement. Mais, une fois face au bel \u00e9talon noir et apr\u00e8s l'avoir caress\u00e9 un peu, il changea d'avis. Il monta sur son cheval et Samuel fit de m\u00eame avec sa jument. Ils \u00e9chang\u00e8rent quelques mots de temps en temps pendant qu'ils trottaient vers leur destination, et une fois arriv\u00e9s, Samuel lui dit qu'il allait v\u00e9rifier si l'\u00e9p\u00e9e \u00e9tait pr\u00eate.\\\\\n\nPendant les moments qu'il passa seul, Alexandre observa autour de lui. Il vit des villageois qui marchaient un peu partout, des vendeurs de fruits et l\u00e9gumes et divers magasins. Soudain, il entendit des cris de d\u00e9tresse. Son cheval sursauta et faillit le faire tomber. Il se retourna pour voir d'o\u00f9 venaient les hurlements, et ses yeux s'\u00e9largirent de surprise : des fourmis g\u00e9antes pi\u00e9tinaient le village.\\\\\n\nSamuel, attir\u00e9 par le tumulte, sortit de l'atelier.\\\\\n\n-- Messire ! cria-t-il, poussant Alexandre \u00e0 faire tourner son cheval vers lui. Tenez ! dit-il en lui lan\u00e7ant une \u00e9p\u00e9e.\\\\\n\n-- Mais qu'est-ce que je suis cens\u00e9 en faire ? dit Alexandre en l'attrapant maladroitement.\\\\\n\n-- Utilisez-la pour chasser les fourmis ! Vous l'avez d\u00e9j\u00e0 fait, voyons !\\\\\n\n-- Je vous assure que non ! Je n'ai aucune id\u00e9e de comment m'y prendre !\\\\\n\n-- J'ai foi en vous, messire ! Bonne chance ! dit Samuel avant de se sauver avec le reste des villageois.\\\\\n\nAlexandre n'eut m\u00eame pas le temps de r\u00e9fl\u00e9chir avant qu'une fourmi lui saute dessus. Par r\u00e9flexe, il la bloqua et s'\u00e9loigna d'elle au galop. Surpris par sa capacit\u00e9 \u00e0 brandir une \u00e9p\u00e9e, il la manipula et la fit tourner dans sa main un peu.\\\\\n\n-- Tant pis, s'ils veulent que je sois le gardien, je vais \u00eatre le gardien ! se dit-il avant de retourner au champ de bataille.\\\\\n\nBien qu'il l'ait fait avec h\u00e9sitation au d\u00e9but, Alexandre se battit f\u00e9rocement et courageusement. Il lan\u00e7a des coups d'\u00e9p\u00e9e et fon\u00e7a vers ses ennemis. Ses chevaliers ne tard\u00e8rent pas \u00e0 le rejoindre et ensemble, ils chass\u00e8rent les fourmis hors du royaume.\\\\\nLes villageois sortirent de leurs abris et les acclam\u00e8rent chaleureusement.\\\\\n\n-- Vive le prince ! Vive les chevaliers ! Vive le royaume du damier ! criaient-ils avec joie.\\\\\n\nDe retour au ch\u00e2teau, les chevaliers et Samuel s'excus\u00e8rent de la grande salle pour laisser Alexandre parler avec la reine.\\\\\n\n-- Maman ! s'\u00e9cria le gardien lorsqu'il vit enfin un visage familier.\\\\\n\nIl fit quelques pas pour embrasser sa m\u00e8re, mais son \u00e9lan fut interrompu par une soudaine sensation de vertige. La derni\u00e8re chose qu'il entendit avant de perdre conscience fut la voix de sa m\u00e8re.\\\\\n\n-- Alexandre, Alexandre, Alex!...\\\\\n\nLorsqu'il ouvrit les yeux de nouveau, il se trouva face \u00e0 face avec sa Maman. Elle lui caressait les cheveux et lui souriait.\\\\\n\n-- Allez, debout petit paresseux. Tu ne veux plus faire de pique-nique ? lui demanda-t-elle. Papa va nous rejoindre d'un moment \u00e0 l'autre.

        "response": "Un bel apr\u00e8s-midi, trois chatons jouaient pr\u00e8s de leurs jeunes propri\u00e9taires, qui \u00e9coutaient une histoire que leur m\u00e8re leur racontait. C'\u00e9tait une histoire qui parlait des aventures d'un astronaute, et bien qu'ils ne pr\u00eatassent pas beaucoup d'attention \u00e0 ce qu'elle disait, leur int\u00e9r\u00eat fut captur\u00e9 lorsqu'ils entendirent les mots : \\textit{voie lact\u00e9e}.\\\\\n\n-- La voie lact\u00e9e ? dit Monocle, une adorable chatonne avec un \u0153il encercl\u00e9 de gris. Est-ce qu'elle veut dire un chemin couvert compl\u00e8tement de lait ?\\\\\n\nOto, le plus jeune d'entre eux, se redressa en imaginant ce qu'elle venait de dire, et Farfouille, leur grand fr\u00e8re, fixa ses yeux avec fascination.\\\\\n\n-- Tu imagines si cet endroit existait vraiment ?\\\\\n\nLes trois chatons furent transport\u00e9s dans un univers fictif, o\u00f9, dans un vaisseau spatial sombre et \u00e9troit, le commandant Farfouille, l'officier scientifique Oto, et la m\u00e9canicienne navigante Monocle \u00e9taient assis l'un \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 de l'autre. Ils naviguaient leur navette \u00e0 travers le cosmos, s\u00e9rieux et silencieux. Leur mission : trouver la voie lact\u00e9e l\u00e9gendaire et en ramener des \u00e9chantillons ; ils n'avaient pas l'intention d'\u00e9chouer.\\\\\n\nIls s'arr\u00eat\u00e8rent pr\u00e8s d'une station spatiale pour s'informer sur le chemin \u00e0 prendre et t\u00e9l\u00e9charg\u00e8rent un guide spatial qu'ils charg\u00e8rent dans le syst\u00e8me de leur vaisseau. Apr\u00e8s s'\u00eatre assur\u00e9s qu'ils avaient assez de carburant et de provisions, ils reprirent leur vol. Farfouille pilota l'engin, Oto fit des recherches sur leur destination, et Monocle surveilla la condition de la navette.\\\\\n\nAu bout d'un moment, elle remarqua un point clignotant sur le radar et le signala \u00e0 ses co\u00e9quipiers.\\\\\n\n-- Doit-on les attaquer, commandant ? demanda-t-elle en se tournant vers Farfouille.\\\\\n\n-- Hmm... Ce sont nos ennemis jur\u00e9s, mais ils semblent se diriger vers une autre destination. Mieux vaut nous occuper de nos propres affaires et les ignorer, r\u00e9pondit le commandant sans quitter l'\u00e9cran du radar des yeux.\\\\\n\n-- Vous ne pensez pas qu'ils veulent go\u00fbter aux d\u00e9lices de la voie lact\u00e9e eux aussi ? demanda Oto, sa queue fr\u00e9missante.\\\\\n\n-- Non, ils visent probablement le fromage de la Lune. Ils ont des go\u00fbts bien excentriques, r\u00e9pondit Farfouille.\\\\\n\n-- N'oubliez pas que ces rats s'en prennent \u00e0 tout, commandant. Ils viendront probablement vers nous apr\u00e8s leur arr\u00eat sur la Lune, ajouta Monocle.\\\\\n\n-- Si c'est le cas, ils deviendront notre repas du soir, dit Farfouille d'un ton assur\u00e9.\\\\\n\nOto et Monocle hoch\u00e8rent la t\u00eate et se concentr\u00e8rent sur leurs t\u00e2ches, tandis que le commandant continuait \u00e0 diriger le vaisseau vers la fameuse rivi\u00e8re de lait flottante, au beau milieu de l'espace. Les trois chatons \u00e9taient de fameux aventuriers de l'espace.\\\\\n\nFarfouille, naturellement curieux et intr\u00e9pide, aimait explorer l'univers ; Oto aimait apprendre et exp\u00e9rimenter ; et Monocle trouvait leurs aventures amusantes et saisissait toutes les occasions de bricoler \u00e0 bord de la navette.\\\\\n\nUne fois arriv\u00e9s \u00e0 destination, les trois chatons enfil\u00e8rent leurs combinaisons spatiales et descendirent du vaisseau. Ils flott\u00e8rent jusqu'\u00e0 atteindre la rivi\u00e8re de lait miraculeuse. La voie lact\u00e9e \u00e9tait majestueuse, son lait d'un blanc \u00e9clatant d\u00e9gageait une douce lueur, illuminant l'espace alentour.\\\\\n\n-- Chat-pristi ! murmura Oto, \u00e9merveill\u00e9.\\\\\n\n-- Je n'en crois pas mes yeux, c'est incroyable ! s'exclama Monocle, tout \u00e0 fait d'accord avec son fr\u00e8re.\\\\\n\n-- Si seulement on pouvait enlever nos casques ! miaula Farfouille avec regret. On aurait pu go\u00fbter au lait directement de la source !\\\\\n\nOto tendit la patte pour toucher le lait et constata qu'il \u00e9tait agr\u00e9ablement chaud.\\\\\n\n-- On dit que ce lait est infus\u00e9 avec de la poussi\u00e8re d'\u00e9toile !\\\\\n\n-- C'est donc pour \u00e7a qu'il brille autant !\\\\\n\n-- Oui, et je pense que c'est aussi ce qui le garde \u00e0 bonne temp\u00e9rature.\\\\\n\n-- Tr\u00eave de bavardage ! les interrompit Farfouille impatiemment. Sortez les aspirateurs et commen\u00e7ons \u00e0 remplir les r\u00e9servoirs.\\\\\n\nOto et Monocle plong\u00e8rent de longs tubes-aspirateurs dans la rivi\u00e8re et commenc\u00e8rent \u00e0 pomper le lait vers les r\u00e9servoirs de leur navette spatiale, tandis que Farfouille surveillait les niveaux. Soudain, Monocle aper\u00e7ut un \u00e9trange signal sur son radar portable.\\\\\n\n-- On dirait qu'un vaisseau s'approche \u00e0 toute vitesse !\\\\\n\n-- Restez ici, je vais v\u00e9rifier sur le radar de bord. Je suis s\u00fbr que ce n'est rien, dit Farfouille.\\\\\n\nQuelques instants plus tard, il ordonna \u00e0 Oto et Monocle de retourner \u00e0 bord du vaisseau.\\\\\n\n-- C'est la navette des rats, ils viennent nous attaquer !\\\\\n\nLorsque les rongeurs approch\u00e8rent, Farfouille visa et commen\u00e7a \u00e0 tirer sur eux avec les armes laser de la navette.\\\\\n\n-- Monocle, t\u00e2che d'esquiver leurs attaques pendant qu'Oto et moi ripostons, ordonna Farfouille.\\\\\n\nComment osaient ces vermines les attaquer, et pr\u00e8s de la voie lact\u00e9e sacr\u00e9e en plus ! Il n'\u00e9tait pas question de les laisser contaminer cette rivi\u00e8re de lait l\u00e9gendaire.\\\\\n\nApr\u00e8s une longue bataille, les rats battirent en retraite, et la voie lact\u00e9e fut sauv\u00e9e par les courageux chatons de l'espace.\\\\\n\n-- Mais qu'est-ce qu'ils font ? demanda une voix.\\\\\n\nLes chatons relev\u00e8rent la t\u00eate et virent leurs jeunes propri\u00e9taires les regarder avec confusion. Monocle sortit de la bo\u00eete en carton o\u00f9 ils jouaient et se dirigea vers sa jeune humaine. Farfouille et Oto firent de m\u00eame, et les trois chatons ronronn\u00e8rent sous les caresses affectueuses de leurs amis humains.\\\\\n\n-- Allez, rentrons ! Je suis s\u00fbre qu'ils ont faim, donnons-leur un peu de lait, dit l'humaine de Monocle \u00e0 ses fr\u00e8res.\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item L'histoire que la m\u00e8re racontait \u00e9tait sur\u2026 ?\n    \\begin{enumerate}\n        \\item[A.] Un astronaute\n        \\item[B.] Un p\u00eacheur\n        \\item[C.] Un m\u00e9decin\n        \\item[D.] Un pilote\n    \\end{enumerate}\n\n    \\item Combien de chatons y avait-il ?\n    \\begin{enumerate}\n        \\item[A.] Un\n        \\item[B.] Deux\n        \\item[C.] Trois\n        \\item[D.] Quatre\n    \\end{enumerate}\n\n    \\item Qui est-ce qui avait l'\u0153il encercl\u00e9 de gris ?\n    \\begin{enumerate}\n        \\item[A.] Oto\n        \\item[B.] Monocle\n        \\item[C.] Farfouille\n        \\item[D.] Aucun des chatons\n    \\end{enumerate}\n\n    \\item Le lait de la voie lact\u00e9e \u00e9tait\u2026 ?\n    \\begin{enumerate}\n        \\item[A.] Froid\n        \\item[B.] Color\u00e9\n        \\item[C.] Acide\n        \\item[D.] Chaud\n    \\end{enumerate}\n\n    \\item Qui est-ce qui attaqua le groupe de chatons ?\n    \\begin{enumerate}\n        \\item[A.] Les rats\n        \\item[B.] Les oiseaux\n        \\item[C.] Les chiens\n        \\item[D.] Les criquets\n    \\end{enumerate}\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\\subsection*{Answers}\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item A\n    \\item C\n    \\item D\n    \\item B\n    \\item A\n\\end{enumerate}"

Jettes-y un coup d'\u0153il si tu veux !} \\\\\n\nMarty, intrigu\u00e9 par le concept de collectionner des petits morceaux de papier, accepta l'offre de son ami et commen\u00e7a \u00e0 feuilleter les pages du carnet. \\\\\n\nIl regarda les timbres avec fascination. Quelques-uns avaient des images de personnes sur eux, d'autres avaient des paysages tandis que certains avaient des machines, des trains et des animaux. \\\\\n\nIl avait aim\u00e9 les couleurs des timbres, mais ce qui l'int\u00e9ressa le plus \u00e9tait la collection en elle-m\u00eame. Les seules choses qu'il avait collectionn\u00e9es dans sa vie \u00e9taient des armures dans un jeu et malgr\u00e9 qu'il s'en \u00e9tait vant\u00e9 devant ses amis, il ne pensait pas que c'\u00e9tait aussi int\u00e9ressant que la collection de timbres de son ami, qui resta dans sa t\u00eate jusqu'\u00e0 ce qu'il rentre chez lui. \\\\\n\nEn r\u00e9alit\u00e9, il avait vraiment envie de commencer une collection \u00e0 lui. Mais... que pouvait-il collectionner ? \u00c0 ce qu'il savait, aucun de ses parents n'avaient de correspondants \u00e9trangers qui leur envoyaient des lettres et donc, il ne pouvait pas collectionner des timbres. \\\\\n\nIl supposa qu'il pouvait collectionner ce qu'il voulait et c'\u00e9tait bien \u00e7a le probl\u00e8me, il n'avait aucune id\u00e9e sur quoi choisir ! \\\\\n\nIl s'installa devant son ordinateur et chercha quelques id\u00e9es en ligne. \\\\\n\nCertaines personnes collectionnaient des fleurs s\u00e9ch\u00e9es, apparemment, ce qui ne l'int\u00e9ressa pas vraiment car les seules fleurs qu'il y avait dans le jardin de sa maison \u00e9taient des roses. \\\\\n\nIl trouva aussi des gens qui collectionnaient des pi\u00e8ces de monnaie provenant de diff\u00e9rents pays, c'\u00e9tait int\u00e9ressant mais il ne voyageait pas et donc cette option avait \u00e9t\u00e9 abandonn\u00e9e. \\\\\n\nCertaines personnes collectionnaient des bandes dessin\u00e9es et il pensa qu'il pr\u00e9f\u00e9rait regarder des dessins anim\u00e9s au lieu de lire des bandes dessin\u00e9es et les acheter rien que pour les collectionner \u00e9tait du g\u00e2chis. \\\\\n\nL'un des objets collectionn\u00e9s les plus bizarres qu'il trouva \u00e9taient des papillons. \\\\\n\n\\textit{-Argh, c'est tellement flippant...} murmura-t-il \u00e0 lui-m\u00eame. \\\\\n\nIl ne savait pas vraiment pourquoi les gens voudraient garder des cadavres de papillons chez eux, mais en y pensant, les collections de fleurs s\u00e9ch\u00e9es \u00e9taient presque la m\u00eame chose. \\\\\n\nIl vit aussi qu'il \u00e9tait possible de collectionner des pierres min\u00e9rales et des cristaux mais il n'\u00e9tait pas vraiment int\u00e9ress\u00e9 par ce type d'objets et il ne voulait pas aller en randonn\u00e9e pour les trouver. \\\\\n\nL'une des choses les plus int\u00e9ressantes que les gens collectionnaient \u00e9taient les m\u00e9dailles et il trouva \u00e7a tr\u00e8s cool, il les collectionnerait peut-\u00eatre une fois que son \u00e9quipe de foot \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole commencerait les comp\u00e9titions. \\\\\n\nPour l'instant, il allait continuer \u00e0 chercher. \\\\\n\nDans un article, il lut qu'on pouvait collectionner n'importe quoi, du moment que c'est quelque chose que l'on aime et qu'il n'y avait pas de r\u00e8gles. \\\\\n\nLes gens collectionnaient des trucs qu'ils aimaient et qui les amusaient. \\\\\n\nIl passa quelques instants \u00e0 penser \u00e0 ce qu'il aimait le plus et les seules choses auxquelles il pouvait penser \u00e9taient les jeux vid\u00e9os, le football, le chocolat et le skating. \\\\\n\nIl ne pouvait pas exactement collectionner les jeux vu qu'il les t\u00e9l\u00e9chargeait en ligne et le foot \u00e9tait un sport, pas quelque chose que l'on collectionne ! \\\\\n\nMais... il pouvait collectionner des ballons. \\\\\n\n\\textit{-Trop grands...} il se dit en secouant la t\u00eate. \\\\\n\nIl n'avait pas assez d'espace dans sa chambre o\u00f9 il pourrait les garder. \\\\\n\nLa m\u00eame chose s'appliquait pour les skateboards. \\\\\n\nEt ils \u00e9taient trop chers en plus. \\\\\n\nLa seule chose qui restait \u00e9tait le chocolat. \\\\\n\nMarty fron\u00e7a les sourcils, \u00e7a serait vraiment du g\u00e2chis d'acheter des friandises juste pour les mettre dans une bo\u00eete, alors l\u00e0 le chocolat. \\\\\n\nEt, pour \u00eatre honn\u00eate, il ne se faisait pas confiance pour ne pas les manger imm\u00e9diatement apr\u00e8s les avoir achet\u00e9es. \\\\\n\nC'\u00e9tait juste trop bon ! \\\\\n\nPar contre, le chocolat \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s vari\u00e9 et avait beaucoup de formes et de parfums, les vari\u00e9t\u00e9s \u00e9taient presque infinies ! \\\\\n\nEt donc, \u00e7a serait quelque chose d'int\u00e9ressant \u00e0 collectionner. \\\\\n\nHumm, que faire ? Il eut soudainement une id\u00e9e qui pourrait r\u00e9gler ses probl\u00e8mes. \\\\\n\nIl pourrait simplement collectionner les emballages ! Oui, tous les types de chocolat \u00e9taient emball\u00e9s ou dans une bo\u00eete. \\\\\n\nComme \u00e7a il pourrait manger le chocolat et collectionner les emballages. \\\\\n\nTout le monde gagne ! \\\\\n\n\\textit{-Je suis un g\u00e9nie !} il pensa avec fiert\u00e9. \\\\\n\nIl ouvrit un tiroir et y fouilla pour un moment avant d'en sortir une barre de chocolat qu'il y avait gard\u00e9e. \\\\\n\n\\textit{-\u00c7a va \u00eatre le premier \u00e9l\u00e9ment de ma collection,} dit-il avant d'aller sur son bureau et de prendre un carnet neuf. \\\\\n\n\\textit{-Je vais coller les emballages ici.} \\\\\n\nIl avait pens\u00e9 que l'id\u00e9e de son ami de garder les timbres dans un carnet \u00e9tait intelligente et il voulait faire la m\u00eame chose. \\\\\n\nIl pr\u00e9para du ruban adh\u00e9sif et un feutre pour noter la date du jour et \u00e9crire une petite note et il d\u00e9balla la barre de chocolat. \\\\\n\nIl savoura son go\u00fbt sucr\u00e9 et une fois qu'il en avait fini, il utilisa une lingette pour nettoyer les quelques endroits o\u00f9 il y avait du chocolat fondu coll\u00e9 \u00e0 l'int\u00e9rieur de l'emballage. \\\\\n\nUne fois que le tout avait s\u00e9ch\u00e9, il \u00e9tendit l'emballage et le mit sur une page du carnet avant de l'y fixer avec du ruban adh\u00e9sif. \\\\\n\nIl \u00e9crivit avec son feutre sur la page sous l'emballage et ferma le carnet avec un sourire satisfait. \\\\\n\nIl resta en place pour un moment avant de courir hors de sa chambre pour parler \u00e0 ses parents de son nouveau loisir. \\\\\n\nApr\u00e8s tout, il avait besoin de leur soutien pour acheter le chocolat et \u00e9tendre sa collection ! \\\\\n\nSes parents \u00e9taient amus\u00e9s et apr\u00e8s qu'il eut promis d'\u00eatre responsable et de ne pas manger trop de chocolat, ils approuv\u00e8rent.\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item Qui est le personnage principal ?\n    \\begin{enumerate}\n        \\item[A.] Marty\n        \\item[B.] Mason\n        \\item[C.] Max\n        \\item[D.] Miles\n    \\end{enumerate}\n\n    \\item O\u00f9 \u00e9tait-il au d\u00e9but de l'histoire ?\n    \\begin{enumerate}\n        \\item[A.] Chez son oncle\n        \\item[B.] Dans la chambre de son fr\u00e8re\n        \\item[C.] Chez son ami\n        \\item[D.] \u00c0 l'\u00e9cole de son cousin\n    \\end{enumerate}\n\n    \\item Qu'avait-il vu sur le bureau ?\n    \\begin{enumerate}\n        \\item[A.] Une bande dessin\u00e9e\n        \\item[B.] Un carnet\n        \\item[C.] Un t\u00e9l\u00e9phone\n        \\item[D.] Un ordinateur\n    \\end{enumerate}\n\n    \\item Que collectionnait son ami ?\n    \\begin{enumerate}\n        \\item[A.] Des timbres\n        \\item[B.] Des coquillages\n        \\item[C.] Des figurines\n        \\item[D.] Des cartes postales\n    \\end{enumerate}\n\n    \\item Que promit Marty \u00e0 ses parents \u00e0 la fin de l'histoire ?\n    \\begin{enumerate}\n        \\item[A.] Qu'il allait payer pour ses chocolats lui-m\u00eame\n        \\item[B.] Qu'il n'allait pas manger trop de chocolat\n        \\item[C.] Qu'il allait partager ses chocolats avec eux\n        \\item[D.] Qu'il allait se brosser les dents apr\u00e8s avoir mang\u00e9 les chocolats\n    \\end{enumerate}\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\\subsection*{Answers}\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item A\n    \\item C\n    \\item B\n    \\item A\n    \\item B\n\\end{enumerate}"

Aide-moi \u00e0 rassembler les autres.\\\\\n\nLorsque tout le monde fut r\u00e9uni, Lucien leur demanda de s'asseoir en cercle puis commen\u00e7a \u00e0 parler avec un ton s\u00e9rieux.\\\\\n\n-- On va jouer au village maudit, leur annon\u00e7a-t-il.\\\\\nIl s'agit d'un village envahi par les ogres et les sorci\u00e8res.\\\\\nLes villageois doivent se cacher et \u00e9viter de se faire attraper par les ogres pour enfin aller au ch\u00e2teau et alerter les soldats et sauver le village,\\\\\nexpliqua Lucien en montrant les soldats que Damien avait align\u00e9s.\\\\\n-- Ils doivent souvent changer de cachette car les ogres peuvent les renifler s'ils restent dans le m\u00eame endroit trop longtemps.\\\\\nEt quoi qu'il arrive, ils ne doivent jamais laisser une sorci\u00e8re leur mettre la main dessus.\\\\\n\nIl d\u00e9signa \u00e0 chacun son r\u00f4le.\\\\\n\n-- Pierre, \u00c9lo\u00efse et Manon sont les ogres.\\\\\n\n-- H\u00e9 ! Mais je ne veux pas \u00eatre une ogresse ! protesta Manon.\\\\\n\n-- C'est comme \u00e7a. Tu seras la princesse dans la prochaine partie, lui dit Lucien.\\\\\n\nLa fillette, \u00e9tant la plus jeune du groupe et donc la plus na\u00efve, ne s'\u00e9tait pas rendu compte qu'il n'y avait pas de princesse dans le jeu, et se contenta de jouer le r\u00f4le de l'ogresse pour le moment,\\\\\npermettant \u00e0 Lucien de continuer.\\\\\n\n-- Damien, moi et Sabine sommes les villageois.\\\\\n\nSabine, confuse par l'affectation des r\u00f4les, lui demanda qui joueront les r\u00f4les des sorci\u00e8res puisque tout le monde avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 un r\u00f4le.\\\\\nLucien se pencha vers le groupe d'enfants et dit d'une voix basse et mena\u00e7ante :\\\\\n\n-- Les sorci\u00e8res\u2026 c'est les aides maternelles !\\\\\n\nLe groupe laissa \u00e9chapper quelques exclamations et cris de surprise avant de se lever et partir assumer leurs positions.\\\\\n\nLes ogres dormirent pendant que les villageois all\u00e8rent se cacher.\\\\\nLucien se plongea dans le monde qu'il venait de cr\u00e9er.\\\\\n\nD\u00e9sormais, sa cr\u00e8che ressemblait aux bois m\u00e9di\u00e9vaux qu'on trouve dans les contes de f\u00e9es et lui-m\u00eame se voyait v\u00eatu d'un pantalon moulant marron, d'une cotte-hardie verte et chauss\u00e9 d'une paire de bottes us\u00e9es.\\\\\nIl courut, essouffl\u00e9, et se cacha derri\u00e8re un arbre.\\\\\nIl jeta un coup d'\u0153il furtif pour voir si les ogres s'\u00e9taient r\u00e9veill\u00e9s et vit qu'en effet, ils l'\u00e9taient.\\\\\nIl les guetta et les vit en train de marcher dans diff\u00e9rentes directions, s'arr\u00eatant pour chercher derri\u00e8re des arbres ou \u00e0 l'int\u00e9rieur des grottes.\\\\\n\n\u00c0 un moment, lorsqu'il vit que les ogres lui tournaient le dos, il fila \u00e0 toute vitesse pour changer d'abri.\\\\\nSon c\u0153ur battait la chamade et il \u00e9tait tremp\u00e9 de sueur lorsqu'il s'accroupit derri\u00e8re un buisson.\\\\\nIl \u00e9carta son feuillage et vit Damien qui essayait de se faufiler derri\u00e8re les grandes b\u00eates, mais par malchance,\\\\\ncelui-ci ne vit pas la pi\u00e8ce de Lego--plut\u00f4t la branche qui \u00e9tait sur son chemin et marcha dessus, alertant les ogres de sa pr\u00e9sence.\\\\\n\nLucien, souhaitant sauver son ami, prit une des baies du buisson et la jeta sur l'ogre le plus proche de Damien, d\u00e9tournant son attention et permettant \u00e0 l'autre villageois de s'enfuir \u00e0 temps.\\\\\nLucien profita de la confusion pour changer, lui aussi, de cachette.\\\\\nIl grimpa sur un arbre et regarda du haut de son perchoir pour voir comment les autres s'en sortaient.\\\\\n\nDamien se tenait debout derri\u00e8re un arbre, inaper\u00e7u par les ogres, et Sabine tentait de changer de cachette mais sans succ\u00e8s.\\\\\nLorsqu'elle se jeta enfin dans la gueule du loup, la plus jeune ogresse lui mit la main dessus.\\\\\n\nNavr\u00e9 par le sort de sa voisine, Lucien secoua la t\u00eate avant de se rappeler qu'il devait changer de cachette avant qu'il ne se fasse rep\u00e9rer.\\\\\nEn se dirigeant vers un autre arbre, il vit du coin de l'\u0153il que Damien aussi s'\u00e9tait fait capturer.\\\\\n\nMalgr\u00e9 sa tristesse, il savait qu'il devait continuer, ne serait-ce que pour sauver le village. Trois contre un, ses chances de survie \u00e9taient minces, mais il refusait de renoncer \u00e0 sa qu\u00eate.\\\\\n\nIl respira profond\u00e9ment avant de foncer vers les soldats.\\\\\nIl \u00e9tait si proche ! Il allait y arriver ! Ses jambes ne le tenaient plus, ses poumons br\u00fblaient et le vent soufflait contre lui mais rien ne l'arr\u00eata.\\\\\n\n\u00c0 deux pas des soldats, il heurta un grand mur qui apparut de nulle part.\\\\\nL'impact le lan\u00e7a \u00e0 terre et il entendit Sabine s'exclamer :\\\\\n\n-- Non ! La sorci\u00e8re l'a eu !\\\\\n\nExpuls\u00e9 de son monde fantastique, Lucien fit un petit sourire penaud \u00e0 son institutrice avant de s'excuser.\\\\\n\n-- Ce n'est pas grave, dit-elle avec un sourire.\\\\\n-- Je suis venue vous chercher pour le d\u00e9jeuner.\\\\\nIl y a une soupe de citrouille dans le chaudron qui n'attend que vous !\\\\\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item Pourquoi Lucien s'ennuyait-il?\n    \\begin{enumerate}\n        \\item[A.] \u00c0 cause de la chaleur\n        \\item[B.] \u00c0 cause de la pluie\n        \\item[C.] Parce qu'il \u00e9tait seul\n        \\item[D.] Parce qu'il \u00e9tait malade\n    \\end{enumerate}\n\n    \\item Quel jeu avait sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 Damien \u00e0 Lucien?\n    \\begin{enumerate}\n        \\item[A.] Cache-cache\n        \\item[B.] Chat perch\u00e9\n        \\item[C.] Jacques a dit\n        \\item[D.] Saute-mouton\n    \\end{enumerate}\n\n    \\item Qui est-ce qui ne voulait pas \u00eatre une ogresse ?\n    \\begin{enumerate}\n        \\item[A.] Manon\n        \\item[B.] Laura\n        \\item[C.] Marie\n        \\item[D.] Sabine\n    \\end{enumerate}\n\n    \\item Que portait Lucien?\n    \\begin{enumerate}\n        \\item[A.] Des pantoufles en verre\n        \\item[B.] Des baskets tennis\n        \\item[C.] Des bottes us\u00e9es\n        \\item[D.] Des claquettes\n    \\end{enumerate}\n\n    \\item Qui avait sauv\u00e9 Damien lorsqu'il avait failli se faire attraper la premi\u00e8re fois ?\n    \\begin{enumerate}\n        \\item[A.] Pierre\n        \\item[B.] Sabine\n        \\item[C.] Manon\n        \\item[D.] Lucien\n    \\end{enumerate}\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\\subsection*{Answers}\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item B\n    \\item A\n    \\item A\n    \\item C\n    \\item D\n\\end{enumerate}"

        "response": "Sous le soleil brillant de l'\u00e9t\u00e9, deux filles jouaient joyeusement ensemble \u00e0 la marelle. Charlotte et Ines \u00e9taient meilleures amies. Elles \u00e9taient ins\u00e9parables et se sentaient chanceuses d'\u00eatre dans la m\u00eame classe et d'habiter dans le m\u00eame quartier. Elles se connaissaient depuis leurs jours pass\u00e9s dans le bac \u00e0 sable et s'imaginaient qu'elles resteraient meilleures amies jusqu'\u00e0 la mort. Les deux filles s'aimaient beaucoup et \u00e9taient proches comme des s\u0153urs.\\\\\n\nCe matin, Ines avait ramen\u00e9 de la craie et propos\u00e9 \u00e0 sa copine de jouer au fameux jeu. Charlotte accepta avec enthousiasme et se mit \u00e0 chercher un caillou pendant qu'Ines tra\u00e7ait le plateau de jeu. Une fois que tout \u00e9tait pr\u00eat, leur partie commen\u00e7a. Ines jeta le caillou sur la premi\u00e8re case et commen\u00e7a \u00e0 faire le parcours \u00e0 cloche-pied. Lorsqu'elle fit son retour et tenta de lancer le caillou sur la deuxi\u00e8me case, celui-ci atterrit sur la troisi\u00e8me, et elle passa son tour.\\\\\n\nUn peu plus tard, quand Ines prit de nouveau son tour, Charlotte interrompit son parcours en lui disant qu'elle avait march\u00e9 sur le trait.\\\\\n\n-- Mais non, j'\u00e9tais assez loin des bords de la case, protesta Ines.\\\\\n\n-- Mais si, tu ne l'as peut-\u00eatre pas vu toi-m\u00eame, mais d'o\u00f9 je suis, c'\u00e9tait clair que tu avais march\u00e9 dessus ! insista Charlotte.\\\\\n\n-- Tu es s\u00fbre que tu ne dis pas \u00e7a juste pour avoir ton tour ? dit Ines, plissant les yeux avec suspicion.\\\\\n\n-- Bien s\u00fbr que non, comment peux-tu dire \u00e7a ! r\u00e9pondit Charlotte en fron\u00e7ant les sourcils.\\\\\n\nLeur discussion se transforma vite en conflit, et les deux filles finirent par se disputer. Par ent\u00eatement, aucune d'elles ne quitta l'aire de jeux ni ne continua \u00e0 jouer. Elles s'assirent, le dos tourn\u00e9 l'une vers l'autre, boudant en silence, jusqu'\u00e0 ce qu'une vieille dame v\u00eent les saluer.\\\\\n\n-- Bonjour Ines, bonjour Charlotte. Comment allez-vous, mes petites ?\\\\\n\n-- Bonjour, Madame Morel, dirent-elles en m\u00eame temps, ajoutant qu'elles allaient bien avant de lui demander de ses nouvelles.\\\\\n\n-- Je vais bien, merci, sourit Mme Morel gentiment. J'\u00e9tais en train de ranger mon grenier, et je me demandais si vous voudriez bien me donner un coup de main. Peut-\u00eatre y trouverez-vous quelque chose qui vous plairait, m\u00eame si \u00e7a date de plusieurs d\u00e9cennies.\\\\\n\nBien qu'elles ne se parlent pas, et malgr\u00e9 leur mauvaise humeur, les deux filles \u00e9taient trop polies pour refuser d'aider leur vieille voisine et accept\u00e8rent de l'aider.\\\\\n\n-- Excellent, je vous remercie ! Je vais passer un coup de fil \u00e0 vos m\u00e8res pour les informer que vous \u00eates chez moi, dit Mme Morel, leur promettant aussi des brownies en r\u00e9compense.\\\\\n\nUne fois chez la vieille dame, les deux filles commenc\u00e8rent \u00e0 trier les objets du grenier, mettant d'un c\u00f4t\u00e9 ce qui devait \u00eatre jet\u00e9 et de l'autre ce qui pourrait encore servir. Elles ne savaient pas si Mme Morel voulait garder, donner, ou vendre ces objets, alors elles pr\u00e9f\u00e9raient la laisser d\u00e9cider. Pendant une demi-heure, elles ne se dirent pas un mot, jusqu'\u00e0 ce que Mme Morel v\u00eent v\u00e9rifier si tout allait bien.\\\\\n\n-- Faites attention ! Aidez-vous pour soulever les objets lourds, sinon vous risquez de vous blesser, leur dit-elle avant de les rejoindre dans le m\u00e9nage du grenier.\\\\\n\nAvec leur vieille voisine dans la pi\u00e8ce, les deux filles commenc\u00e8rent \u00e0 se parler, ne serait-ce que pour demander de l'aide de temps en temps. Quelques instants plus tard, Mme Morel les appela pour voir le contenu d'une bo\u00eete en carton.\\\\\n\n-- Ce sont vos jouets ? demanda Charlotte en saisissant une petite poup\u00e9e.\\\\\n\n-- Certains, oui. D'autres \u00e9taient ceux de mes enfants, r\u00e9pondit Mme Morel avec un sourire nostalgique. \u00c7a, par exemple, dit-elle en leur montrant un gros ressort color\u00e9, appartenait \u00e0 ma fille a\u00een\u00e9e, Marie.\\\\\n\nElle tendit le ressort \u00e0 Ines, qui le regarda avec fascination avant de le passer \u00e0 son amie.\\\\\n\n-- Et ce jeu de dominos appartenait \u00e0 mon plus jeune fils, ajouta-t-elle en sortant une petite bo\u00eete en bois.\\\\\n\n-- Et \u00e7a ? dit Charlotte en pointant un petit livret du doigt.\\\\\n\n-- Ah ! s'exclama Mme Morel avec joie en sortant le livret de la bo\u00eete. C'est un album photo rempli de souvenirs avec ma meilleure amie.\\\\\n\nMme Morel ouvrit le petit album et leur montra des photos d'elle et de son amie d'enfance, capturant des moments de leur enfance jusqu'\u00e0 l'adolescence.\\\\\n\n-- Vous aviez l'air tellement heureuses ! s'exclama Ines, trouvant les sourires des deux filles dans les photos contagieux.\\\\\n\n-- On l'\u00e9tait, dit la vieille dame doucement. On \u00e9tait aussi proches que vous l'\u00eates aujourd'hui.\\\\\n\nCharlotte, remarquant que Mme Morel avait conjugu\u00e9 son verbe au pass\u00e9, lui demanda si elles avaient perdu contact.\\\\\n\n-- Non, nous sommes rest\u00e9es meilleures amies jusqu'\u00e0 la fin. L'an dernier, mon amie est d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9e.\\\\\n\n-- Oh\u2026\\\\\n\nCharlotte se sentit coupable d'avoir rappel\u00e9 quelque chose de triste \u00e0 Mme Morel et baissa les yeux.\\\\\n\n-- Je suis d\u00e9sol\u00e9e, dit-elle.\\\\\n\n-- Ce n'est pas ta faute, ma ch\u00e9rie. Et puis, nous avons eu toute notre vie pour nous aimer et nous amuser, dit la vieille dame en prenant les deux filles dans ses bras. Maintenant, c'est \u00e0 votre tour de vous faire de bons souvenirs.\\\\\n\nInes et Charlotte se regard\u00e8rent timidement, un peu embarrass\u00e9es par leur dispute, et \u00e9chang\u00e8rent un sourire. Petit \u00e0 petit, elles recommenc\u00e8rent \u00e0 se parler comme les meilleures amies qu'elles \u00e9taient.\\\\\n\n-- Regarde \u00e7a ! dit Ines \u00e0 sa copine en lui montrant une paire de raquettes de plage.\\\\\n\n-- Oh ! Tu crois que Mme Morel nous laissera les garder ?\\\\\n\nLa dame en personne les rejoignit avec un plateau contenant deux grands verres de lait et une assiette remplie de brownies.\\\\\n\n-- Bien s\u00fbr que vous pouvez les garder !\\\\\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item Comment s'appellent les deux filles ?\n    \\begin{enumerate}\n        \\item[A.] Charlotte et Ingrid\n        \\item[B.] Charlotte et H\u00e9l\u00e8ne\n        \\item[C.] Charlotte et Marie\n        \\item[D.] Charlotte et Ines\n    \\end{enumerate}\n\n    \\item Le jeu auquel les deux filles jouaient est... ?\n    \\begin{enumerate}\n        \\item[A.] Cache-cache\n        \\item[B.] Chat\n        \\item[C.] La marelle\n        \\item[D.] 1,2,3 soleil\n    \\end{enumerate}\n\n    \\item Que demanda la vieille dame aux deux filles ?\n    \\begin{enumerate}\n        \\item[A.] De l'aide pour ranger son grenier\n        \\item[B.] De l'aide pour croiser la route\n        \\item[C.] De l'aide pour faire ses courses\n        \\item[D.] De l'aide pour faire la cuisine\n    \\end{enumerate}\n\n    \\item Parmi ces objets, lequel ne se trouvait pas dans la bo\u00eete en carton ?\n    \\begin{enumerate}\n        \\item[A.] Un album photo\n        \\item[B.] Une corde \u00e0 sauter\n        \\item[C.] Un ressort color\u00e9\n        \\item[D.] Une bo\u00eete de dominos\n    \\end{enumerate}\n\n    \\item Qu'est-ce que Mme Morel apporta aux deux filles ?\n    \\begin{enumerate}\n        \\item[A.] Des brioches\n        \\item[B.] Des brownies\n        \\item[C.] Des cookies\n        \\item[D.] Des fruits\n    \\end{enumerate}\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\\subsection*{Answers}\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item D\n    \\item C\n    \\item A\n    \\item B\n    \\item B\n\\end{enumerate}"

En fait, c'est la raison pour laquelle ce type de logiciel malveillant est nomm\u00e9 un virus.} \\\\\n\\textit{Car \u00e7a marche de la m\u00eame mani\u00e8re qu'un virus de rhume ou de grippe,} sa s\u0153ur lui dit. \\\\\n\n\\textit{-Tu continues \u00e0 r\u00e9p\u00e9ter les mots \u201cce type de logiciel malveillant\u201d, quels sont les autres types ?} Eleanor demanda en se penchant en avant dans sa chaise. \\\\\n\n\\textit{-Eh bien, il y a plusieurs autres types. L'un d'eux est un type qu'on appelle un cheval de Troie.} \\\\\n\\textit{Connais-tu l'histoire du cheval de Troie dans l'histoire ?} \\\\\n\nEleanor secoua la t\u00eate, indiquant que non. \\\\\n\\textit{-Bon, dans la mythologie grecque, on dit que la femme du roi de Sparte, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne, avait \u00e9t\u00e9 kidnapp\u00e9e et emmen\u00e9e \u00e0 Troie.} \\\\\n\\textit{Ceci poussa le roi \u00e0 demander de l'aide aupr\u00e8s des Grecs qui accept\u00e8rent d'aller au secours d'H\u00e9l\u00e8ne.} \\\\\n\n\\textit{Mais, la cit\u00e9 de Troie \u00e9tait prot\u00e9g\u00e9e par de grands murs et on ne pouvait pas y acc\u00e9der facilement et donc le g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Grec Ulysse pensa \u00e0 jouer un tour pour s'y introduire et sauver H\u00e9l\u00e8ne avec ses guerriers.} \\\\\n\n\\textit{Et donc, les Grecs b\u00e2tirent un immense cheval en bois et le laiss\u00e8rent hors du portail de Troie en guise d'offrande et l'arm\u00e9e fit semblant de battre en retraite.} \\\\\n\n\\textit{Les gens de Troie, contents de leur victoire, tir\u00e8rent le cheval \u00e0 l'int\u00e9rieur de la cit\u00e9 et le mirent au centre pour que tout le monde puisse l'admirer.} \\\\\n\n\\textit{La nuit, quand tout le monde dormait, quelques guerriers qui \u00e9taient cach\u00e9s \u00e0 l'int\u00e9rieur du cheval en sortirent et ouvrirent les portails de Troie pour le reste de l'arm\u00e9e et \u00e0 partir de l\u00e0, tu peux facilement deviner qui avait gagn\u00e9 cette guerre.} \\\\\n\nEleanor \u00e9couta l'histoire avec fascination avant de demander quel lien \u00e7a avait avec le logiciel malveillant. \\\\\n\\textit{-Le cheval de Troie marche d'une fa\u00e7on semblable.} \\\\\n\\textit{Il se fait passer pour un logiciel inoffensif pour te pousser \u00e0 le t\u00e9l\u00e9charger et l'installer et une fois sur ton syst\u00e8me, il peut donner acc\u00e8s aux attaquants \u00e0 tes fichiers et ils pourront t'espionner, voler tes fichiers et m\u00eame t\u00e9l\u00e9charger plus de logiciels malveillants sur ton ordinateur.} \\\\\n\n\\textit{-Oh... C'est horrible !} Eleanor dit en regardant l'\u00e9cran de son ordinateur. \\\\\n\nSes t\u00e9l\u00e9chargements \u00e9taient toujours en cours et elle retourna son attention sur sa s\u0153ur. \\\\\n\\textit{Comment pourrais-je prot\u00e9ger mon ordinateur des logiciels malveillants ?} \\\\\n\n\\textit{-Tu peux utiliser un logiciel antivirus.} \\\\\n\\textit{Ils te pr\u00e9viennent en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral quand tu es sur le point de t\u00e9l\u00e9charger quelque chose de suspect et tu peux m\u00eame les utiliser pour nettoyer ton ordinateur et te d\u00e9barrasser des logiciels malveillants qui y sont d\u00e9j\u00e0.} \\\\\n\n\\textit{Comme je l'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 dit, \u00e9vite d'aller sur des sites qui ne sont pas v\u00e9rifi\u00e9s et s\u00e9curis\u00e9s et ne t\u00e9l\u00e9charge rien \u00e0 partir d'une source inconnue.} \\\\\n\n\\textit{Et pour \u00eatre s\u00fbr, s'il y a des fichiers importants sur ton ordinateur, fais-en une copie de secours et charge-la sur un drive en ligne ou sur une cl\u00e9 USB juste pour ne pas perdre tes donn\u00e9es au cas o\u00f9 quelque chose arrive \u00e0 ton syst\u00e8me.} \\\\\n\nEleanor hocha la t\u00eate avec enthousiasme et remercia sa s\u0153ur pour ses explications. \\\\\n\\textit{-Tout est plus clair maintenant.} \\\\\n\nElle se tourna vers son ordinateur et vit que les t\u00e9l\u00e9chargements de ses jeux \u00e9taient termin\u00e9s et elle lan\u00e7a leurs installations avec excitation. \\\\\nMaintenant qu'elle \u00e9tait s\u00fbre qu'ils n'\u00e9taient pas dangereux pour son ordinateur, elle allait s'amuser en y jouant encore plus.\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item Quel est le nom du personnage principal ?\n    \\begin{enumerate}\n        \\item[A.] Ellen\n        \\item[B.] Eliza\n        \\item[C.] Eleanor\n        \\item[D.] Elise\n    \\end{enumerate}\n\n    \\item Que t\u00e9l\u00e9chargeait-elle au d\u00e9but de l'histoire ?\n    \\begin{enumerate}\n        \\item[A.] De la musique\n        \\item[B.] Des images\n        \\item[C.] Des films\n        \\item[D.] Des jeux\n    \\end{enumerate}\n\n    \\item Qui l'avait rejoint dans sa chambre ?\n    \\begin{enumerate}\n        \\item[A.] Sa s\u0153ur\n        \\item[B.] Sa grand-m\u00e8re\n        \\item[C.] Sa tante\n        \\item[D.] Sa m\u00e8re\n    \\end{enumerate}\n\n    \\item D'apr\u00e8s le texte, quelle est la couleur de l'ic\u00f4ne qui indique qu'un site est s\u00fbr ?\n    \\begin{enumerate}\n        \\item[A.] Bleue\n        \\item[B.] Marron\n        \\item[C.] Verte\n        \\item[D.] Rouge\n    \\end{enumerate}\n\n    \\item Lequel de ces logiciels malveillants a \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9 dans le texte ?\n    \\begin{enumerate}\n        \\item[A.] Les adwares\n        \\item[B.] Les logiciels espions\n        \\item[C.] Le Ver\n        \\item[D.] Le cheval de Troie\n    \\end{enumerate}\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\\subsection*{Answers}\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item C\n    \\item D\n    \\item A\n    \\item C\n    \\item D\n\\end{enumerate}"

        "response": "Jennie, Marshall et Ophelia se rassembl\u00e8rent au centre de la maison. Chaque fin de semaine, ils incitaient leur m\u00e8re \u00e0 sortir avec ses amies et \u00e0 se d\u00e9tendre pendant qu'ils nettoyaient la maison avec l'aide de leur p\u00e8re et sous sa surveillance.\n\n\\textit{-Alors voil\u00e0, puisqu'on est \u00e0 court de certaines choses, Papa est sorti acheter ce dont on a besoin mais on peut quand m\u00eame diviser les t\u00e2ches maintenant.} Ophelia, l'a\u00een\u00e9e, dit sur un ton enfantin mais ferme. Son fr\u00e8re et sa s\u0153ur hoch\u00e8rent la t\u00eate en accord et attendirent qu'elle d\u00e9l\u00e9gua leurs t\u00e2ches.\n\n\\textit{-Comme d'habitude, Papa va s'occuper des cuvettes, fen\u00eatres et miroirs.} Elle commen\u00e7a. \\textit{Jennie, tu as fait la vaisselle la semaine pass\u00e9e, donc Marshall va faire cela cette semaine.} Dit-elle \u00e0 sa s\u0153ur. \\textit{Tu vas passer l'aspirateur au salon et au couloir tandis que je m'occupe du linge et je vais aussi faire le parterre de la cuisine. Est-ce que tout le monde a compris?} Encore une fois, les enfants les plus jeunes hoch\u00e8rent leurs t\u00eates.\n\n\u00c0 peine un moment plus tard, leur p\u00e8re ouvrit la porte et ils se dirig\u00e8rent tous vers la cuisine pour leurs nouveaux produits de nettoyage. Marshall prit une paire de gants et une bouteille de savon \u00e0 vaisselle.\n\n\\textit{-Est-ce que je peux aussi remplacer la vieille \u00e9ponge? Elle est devenue d\u00e9gueulasse.} Il demanda \u00e0 son p\u00e8re qui hocha la t\u00eate.\n\n\\textit{-Je vais aussi changer la brosse des toilettes. Il est bien de changer les outils fr\u00e9quemment, plus ils deviennent us\u00e9s plus ils contiennent de bact\u00e9ries.} Son p\u00e8re dit en prenant deux flacons vaporisateurs, une brosse, une paire de gants et un masque qui le prot\u00e9gerait des produits chimiques qui \u00e9taient dans les produits de nettoyage. Jennie, qui \u00e9tait charg\u00e9e de passer l'aspirateur, prit \u00e9galement un des masques pour se prot\u00e9ger de la poussi\u00e8re.\n\nEt quand tout le monde avait ce dont ils avaient besoin, ils se tap\u00e8rent les mains et se mirent au travail.\n\n\\textit{-Allez, les enfants. Montrons \u00e0 Maman comment le nettoyage professionnel se fait!} Leur p\u00e8re dit. Le seul qui resta dans la cuisine \u00e9tait Marshall vu qu'il \u00e9tait celui qui allait faire la vaisselle. La premi\u00e8re chose qu'il fit \u00e9tait de porter le tablier \u00e0 froufrous de sa m\u00e8re vu que celui de son p\u00e8re \u00e9tait trop grand pour lui. Il tourna et rigola en voyant le tablier se bouffer autour de lui. Puis, il glissa ses mains dans les gants en caoutchouc et remplit la cuvette d'eau avant d'ajouter le savon \u00e0 vaisselle.\n\nIl agita ses mains dans l'eau jusqu'\u00e0 ce qu'elle devienne mousseuse et pleine de bulles et il s'amusa \u00e0 faire de petites formes avec la mousse et \u00e0 souffler sur les bulles. Il commen\u00e7a \u00e0 chantonner le g\u00e9n\u00e9rique de son dessin anim\u00e9 pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 et se mit \u00e0 frotter les plats sales, s'assurant que chaque t\u00e2che \u00e9tait partie. Ce serait dommage si sa m\u00e8re devait les laver une deuxi\u00e8me fois s'il ne faisait pas son travail proprement.\n\nDe l'autre c\u00f4t\u00e9 du mur qui s\u00e9parait la cuisine du salon, Jennie avait commenc\u00e9 par faire un peu d'ordre. Elle aimait pr\u00e9tendre qu'elle \u00e9tait en mission urgente et donc, elle r\u00e9gla un minuteur sur le t\u00e9l\u00e9phone de son p\u00e8re et hocha sa t\u00eate avant de commencer. Elle ramassa les objets qui \u00e9taient sur son chemin, comme la couverture qui \u00e9tait sur le fauteuil et la bouteille d'eau qui \u00e9tait sur la table basse, et les mit \u00e0 part avant d'essuyer la poussi\u00e8re qui \u00e9tait sur les meubles.\n\n\\textit{-La voie est libre!} Annon\u00e7a-t-elle au salon vide. \\textit{Initialisation de la partie deux de la mission.} Dit-elle apr\u00e8s avoir d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que rien ne serait sur son chemin. Puis, elle mit l'aspirateur en marche et commen\u00e7a par le tapis. \u00c0 chaque fois qu'elle finissait de nettoyer une partie du salon, elle disait: \\textit{La voie est s\u00fbre!}\n\nDans la salle de bain, Ophelia tria le linge sale et s\u00e9para les v\u00eatements color\u00e9s des blancs. Elle aimait empiler les v\u00eatements color\u00e9s dans l'ordre de leur apparition dans l'arc-en-ciel et elle empila les v\u00eatements blancs en commen\u00e7ant par ceux les moins purs \u00e0 ceux qui \u00e9taient aussi blancs que de la neige.\n\nElle remplit le bouchon de d\u00e9tergent et le mit dans le compartiment correspondant de la machine \u00e0 laver apr\u00e8s s'\u00eatre assur\u00e9e qu'elle avait bien mesur\u00e9. Cela lui donna l'impression d'\u00eatre une chimiste, et elle commen\u00e7a \u00e0 mettre les v\u00eatements dans la machine. Elle appuya sur quelques boutons et le cycle de lavage se lan\u00e7a.\n\nLe p\u00e8re de famille allait de chambre en chambre, nettoyant les fen\u00eatres et les miroirs. La chambre de Marshall n'avait que le miroir qui \u00e9tait mont\u00e9 sur son armoire et une seule fen\u00eatre, et donc il commen\u00e7a par elle, vu qu'elle \u00e9tait la plus facile \u00e0 nettoyer. Et si quelqu'un lui avait demand\u00e9 quelle pi\u00e8ce \u00e9tait la plus difficile, il aurait dit que c'\u00e9tait le salon avec ses fen\u00eatres qui allaient du sol au plafond.\n\nIl \u00e9tait impatient de voir ses enfants grandir pour qu'ils puissent l'aider \u00e0 les nettoyer. Pour l'instant, c'\u00e9tait lui et sa femme qui s'en occupaient, vu que c'\u00e9tait trop dangereux pour les enfants de monter sur des chaises pour arriver aux parties les plus hautes et il se pourrait que l'un d'eux perde son \u00e9quilibre et tombe.\n\nQuand les v\u00eatements avaient fini leur cycle de lavage et firent un tour dans le s\u00e8che-linge, Marshall avait fini de faire la vaisselle et les membres de la famille firent une rotation dans les chambres. Papa alla \u00e0 la salle de bain pour nettoyer les cuvettes, Ophelia alla \u00e0 la cuisine pour faire le parterre et Marshall alla dans sa chambre pour organiser son bureau et ranger ses jouets.\n\nJennie, d'autre part, \u00e9tait en train de passer l'aspirateur dans la chambre de ses parents. Tous les enfants avaient trouv\u00e9 un moyen de s'amuser en faisant leurs t\u00e2ches et l'id\u00e9e de rendre leur m\u00e8re fi\u00e8re et heureuse les poussa \u00e0 travailler dur.\n\nQuand tout le monde avait fini ses corv\u00e9es, leur p\u00e8re les emmena d\u00e9jeuner dehors. \\textit{-C'est plus juste ainsi.

}\\\\\n\nWenn er das Glas heben wollte, w\u00fcrde die Milch auf den Tisch fallen. \\\\\n\\textit{If he wanted to get a glass, the milk would go down on the table.} \\\\\n\nSein Sohn und seine

auf dem Boden. \\\\\n\\textit{I have enough of the spilled milk, loud eating and food on the floor.\u201d} \\\\\n\nDer Sohn und die Schwiegertochter stellten einen kleinen Tisch in die Ecke des

\\\\\n\\textit{The grandfather was eating there, while the rest of the family enjoyed the meal.} \\\\\n\nAls der Gro\u00dfvater ein paar Schalen zerbrach, wurde sein Essen in einer Holzschale serviert. \\\\\n\\textit{After the grandfather had broken a few bowls, his food was served in a wooden bowl. }\\\\\n\nWenn die Familie manchmal den Gro\u00dfvater ansah, sahen sie manchmal die Tr\u00e4nen in seinen Augen, wenn er allein da sa\u00df. \\\\\n\\textit{When the family looked at the grandfather, they would sometimes see the tears in his eyes as he sat there alone.} \\\\\n\nDennoch, die einzigen Worte, die das junge Paar f\u00fcr ihn hatte, waren Worte der Wut, wenn etwas auf den Boden fiel. \\\\\n\\textit{Nevertheless, the only words the young couple had for him were words of anger if something fell to the floor.} \\\\\n\nDer vierj\u00e4hrige Enkel sah schweigend zu. \\\\\n\\textit{The four-year-old grandson looked in silence. }\\\\\n\nEines Abends vor dem

        "response": "En un jour chaud et ensoleill\u00e9, tandis que les criquets chantaient et que les fourmis montaient en queue sur un arbre, Jacob \u00e9tait \u00e0 quatre pattes dans le petit jardin de sa maison et cherchait sans rel\u00e2che dans l'herbe en qu\u00eate du tr\u00e8fle \u00e0 quatre feuilles l\u00e9gendaire. \\\\\nLe but principal de sa recherche \u00e9tait de s'attribuer la chance qui venait de l'objet, comme tout le monde. \\\\\nIl ne croyait pas qu'il allait trouver facilement un fer \u00e0 cheval dans la ville et il ne voulait certainement pas avoir la patte d'un lapin ! Quel genre de personne sans c\u0153ur pourrait faire \u00e7a \u00e0 un pauvre lapin ?! \\\\\nEt donc, sa seule option \u00e9tait un tr\u00e8fle \u00e0 quatre feuilles. S'il arrivait \u00e0 l'avoir, il aurait de la chance et s'il avait de la chance, tout irait \u00e0 merveille dans sa vie. \\\\\n\nLe seul probl\u00e8me \u00e9tait que, malgr\u00e9 sa recherche m\u00e9ticuleuse, il n'arrivait pas \u00e0 trouver l'objet en question. \\\\\nIl commen\u00e7ait \u00e0 se sentir frustr\u00e9 apr\u00e8s une demi-heure de recherche et il consid\u00e9rait s\u00e9rieusement d'abandonner sa t\u00e2che. \\\\\n\\textit{-Je commence \u00e0 croire qu'ils n'ont jamais exist\u00e9...} murmura-t-il de mani\u00e8re grincheuse en se tapotant les mains pour se d\u00e9barrasser de la terre avec un souffle. \\\\\n\n\\textit{-Qu'est-ce qui te fait marmonner comme \u00e7a, petit ?} La voix de sa grande s\u0153ur survint de derri\u00e8re lui, le faisant sursauter. \\\\\n\\textit{-Leah ! Ne viens pas derri\u00e8re les gens ainsi !} la gronda-t-il en fron\u00e7ant les sourcils. \\\\\n\\textit{-Pardon,} dit-elle en rigolant avant de s'asseoir sur l'herbe \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 de lui. \\\\\n\\textit{-Alors, pourquoi es-tu si contrari\u00e9 ?} demanda-t-elle en lui pin\u00e7ant la joue avant qu'il ne tape sa main. \\\\\n\nIl laissa \u00e9chapper un souffle avec un regard mis\u00e9rable et se massa la tempe pour se calmer. \\\\\n\\textit{-J'ai cherch\u00e9 partout \u00e0 travers le jardin pour trouver un tr\u00e8fle \u00e0 quatre feuilles mais apparemment, tous les tr\u00e8fles ici n'ont que trois feuilles.} \\\\\n\n\\textit{-Je vois,} Leah dit en mettant un bras sur ses genoux avant de mettre son menton dessus. \\\\\n\\textit{-Et pourquoi as-tu besoin d'en trouver un \u00e0 quatre feuilles ?} \\\\\n\n\\textit{-Pour avoir de la chance, bien s\u00fbr. Pourquoi d'autre ?} dit-il en froissant son front. \\\\\n\\textit{-Et bien, pourquoi as-tu besoin d'avoir de la chance ?} \\\\\nEst-ce qu'elle jouait l'idiote expr\u00e8s ? Il savait \u00e0 quel point elle \u00e9tait intelligente, alors elle \u00e9tait s\u00fbrement en train de le taquiner. \\\\\nJacob n'\u00e9tait pas d'humeur \u00e0 se faire taquiner ! \\\\\n\n\\textit{-Et bien pour tout ! La chance nous aide avec tout, n'est-ce pas ? \u00c7a rend tout plus facile et meilleur ! Je serai meilleur en football et j'aurai de meilleures notes et je gagnerai chaque partie de jeux vid\u00e9o que je jouerai !} expliqua-t-il en agitant ses mains un peu partout. \\\\\n\nSa grande s\u0153ur rigola et lui \u00e9bouriffa les cheveux. \\\\\n\\textit{-Calme-toi, mon grand. Je comprends.} \\\\\n\\textit{-Alors tu vois pourquoi j'ai besoin de le trouver.} \\\\\n\n\\textit{-Je ne crois pas que la chance marche autant que tu le penses, tu sais ?} Leah dit. \\\\\nJacob souffla et roula des yeux. \\\\\n\\textit{-Ouais, c'est \u00e7a. Elle ne savait rien... Les adultes ne savaient rien sur ses probl\u00e8mes.} \\\\\n\n\\textit{-Non, je suis s\u00e9rieuse. Est-ce que tu connais quelqu'un qui a r\u00e9ussi dans sa vie en comptant sur la chance ?} lui demanda-t-elle en arquant ses sourcils. \\\\\n\\textit{-Et bien... non, mais...} Il prit un moment pour penser \u00e0 un argument mais ne pouvait pas en avoir un. \\\\\n\n\\textit{-Tu vois ? La majorit\u00e9 des gens qui ont accompli leurs buts comptent sur autre chose. Peux-tu deviner ce que c'est ?} demanda-t-elle avec un sourire taquin. \\\\\n\\textit{-Les miracles ?} Jacob r\u00e9pondit avec sarcasme, la faisant rire. \\\\\n\\textit{-Non, petit malin ! Le travail. Les gens travaillent dur pour r\u00e9aliser leurs r\u00eaves. Ils s'am\u00e9liorent dans leur m\u00e9tier en travaillant dur et en s'appliquant et ils amassent de l'exp\u00e9rience et du savoir qui les aideraient par la suite \u00e0 travailler plus rapidement et de fa\u00e7on meilleure,} expliqua-t-elle. \\\\\n\n\\textit{-Ah, bon ? Donne-moi un exemple.} Le petit gar\u00e7on la d\u00e9fia en croisant les bras. \\\\\n\\textit{-Toi ! Tu te rappelles \u00e0 quel point tu \u00e9tais faible en Histoire ?} Jacob fit une grimace en pensant \u00e0 ses vieilles notes en Histoire. \\\\\nIl d\u00e9testait la mati\u00e8re et avait refus\u00e9 de la r\u00e9viser. \\\\\n\nMais, il \u00e9tait arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 s'y am\u00e9liorer et il avait trouv\u00e9 une mani\u00e8re de m\u00e9moriser ses le\u00e7ons de mani\u00e8re efficace quand il s'\u00e9tait d\u00e9cid\u00e9 \u00e0 le faire et avec l'aide de Leah. \\\\\nMaintenant, l'Histoire \u00e9tait devenue l'une de ses mati\u00e8res pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9es et il n'avait que de bonnes notes. \\\\\n\n\\textit{-D'accord. Quoi d'autre ?} demanda-t-il, pas tr\u00e8s convaincu. \\\\\nLeah se tourna pour regarder la maison puis autour d'elle pour s'assurer que personne d'autre que Jacob ne pouvait l'entendre. \\\\\n\\textit{-Tu te souviens \u00e0 quel point Maman \u00e9tait mauvaise en jardinage ?} \\\\\n\nJacob rigola en pensant \u00e0 toutes les pauvres plantes que sa m\u00e8re avait noy\u00e9es en les arrosant plus qu'il ne fallait. \\\\\n\\textit{-Elle a fait beaucoup de progr\u00e8s...} dit-il en regardant les rosiers qui \u00e9taient en pleine floraison gr\u00e2ce aux soins de sa m\u00e8re. \\\\\n\n\\textit{-Et tout le monde sait que j'\u00e9tais tr\u00e8s mauvaise en basketball quand je venais tout juste de commencer. Maintenant, regarde-moi ! Apr\u00e8s des mois et des mois de travail dur, je suis devenue capitaine de mon \u00e9quipe \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole !} Leah dit avec un sourire fier. \\\\\n\n\\textit{-C'est vrai. Papa n'arr\u00eate pas de parler de tes exploits,} Jacob dit avec un sourire taquin. \\\\\n\\textit{-Tu vois ? En r\u00e9alit\u00e9, tout le monde peut devenir excellent dans n'importe quel domaine. Tu es devenu meilleur en Histoire apr\u00e8s avoir fait des efforts. Maman est devenue meilleure en jardinage parce qu'elle a refus\u00e9 d'abandonner malgr\u00e9 toutes les plantes qu'elle avait tu\u00e9es et moi, je suis devenue meilleure en basketball apr\u00e8s des heures et des heures d'entra\u00eenement.} \\\\\n\n\\textit{Toute personne qui est bonne dans un domaine \u00e9tait mauvaise au d\u00e9but et s'est seulement am\u00e9lior\u00e9e apr\u00e8s s'\u00eatre exerc\u00e9e et avoir travaill\u00e9 dur. La chance est une jolie chose mais si tout le monde comptait sur elle, on n'aurait pas de progr\u00e8s dans tous les domaines.} \\\\\n\nJacob hocha la t\u00eate et sourit. \\\\\n\\textit{-Je comprends. Et puis qui a besoin de chance ? Je peux tout faire tout seul.} \\\\\n\n\\textit{-Et si tu as des soucis, tu peux toujours demander de l'aide,} Leah lui rappela avec un sourire. \\\\\nJacob sourit et la regarda d'un air penaud. \\\\\n\\textit{-Alors... tu veux bien m'aider pour trouver le tr\u00e8fle \u00e0 quatre feuilles...? Pas pour avoir de la chance !

        "response": "Le soleil baignait le monde dans sa chaleur et sa lumi\u00e8re \u00e9claircissait les fleurs en \u00e9closion. \\\\\nCe beau matin, une petite fille regardait le joli jardin de sa grand-m\u00e8re depuis le bord de la fen\u00eatre de sa chambre, en tenant un verre de limonade dans sa main. \\\\\nElle soupira joyeusement apr\u00e8s avoir pris une bonne bouff\u00e9e d'air frais qui portait les douces odeurs des plantes puis, pencha sa t\u00eate sur la fen\u00eatre, ayant la paisible sensation d'\u00eatre chez elle. \\\\\n\nSoudain, un petit mouvement irr\u00e9gulier saisit son attention et elle concentra son regard sur la source de ce mouvement qui \u00e9tait une toute petite araign\u00e9e suspendue au bout d'un fil qui \u00e9tait emport\u00e9 par la brise. \\\\\nFelicity rigola sur la sc\u00e8ne bizarre qui lui rappela, en fait, un film qu'elle avait regard\u00e9 il n'y avait pas tr\u00e8s longtemps avec ses grands-parents. \\\\\n\n\\textit{-Cette araign\u00e9e para\u00eet exactement comme les cambrioleurs qui \u00e9taient descendus du plafond pour voler le joyau du mus\u00e9e royal,} pensa-t-elle en regardant le petit insecte s'\u00e9loigner d'elle, flottant vers l'inconnu. \\\\\n\nElle tourna son regard vers la plante empot\u00e9e qui \u00e9tait juste sous la fen\u00eatre et regarda une abeille qui avait la t\u00eate dans une fleur et elle laissa \u00e9chapper un rire. \\\\\n\\textit{-Quelle petite cr\u00e9ature loufoque !} dit-elle en regardant le petit insecte volant se tortiller pour aller plus profond\u00e9ment dans la fleur. \\\\\n\nLes abeilles travaillaient tellement dur ! La petite fille soupira et pensa que la vie devait \u00eatre tr\u00e8s int\u00e9ressante pour les insectes. \\\\\nElle se demanda ce que \u00e7a ferait de voir les choses de leur perspective. \\\\\n\nTout devait para\u00eetre gigantesque et les petits brins d'herbe qu'elle voyait devaient \u00eatre une jungle pour les minuscules insectes qui r\u00e9sidaient dans le jardin de sa grand-m\u00e8re. \\\\\n\n\\textit{-Si seulement je pouvais r\u00e9tr\u00e9cir pour un jour...} pensa-t-elle en baillant avec paresse juste avant de s'endormir contre la fen\u00eatre. \\\\\n\nQuand elle se leva, elle \u00e9tait toujours sur le bord de la fen\u00eatre dans la maison de sa grand-m\u00e8re mais elle \u00e9tait devenue beaucoup plus petite. \\\\\n\n\\textit{-Fais attention \u00e0 ce que tu souhaites, hein...?} elle murmura \u00e0 elle-m\u00eame en regardant autour d'elle avec fascination. \\\\\nElle ne sentit aucun regret, par contre. Elle \u00e9tait excit\u00e9e de vivre ce nouveau changement et \u00e9tait impatiente de voir comment sa journ\u00e9e allait se d\u00e9rouler. \\\\\n\nElle passa un peu de temps \u00e0 observer son entourage. \\\\\nTout paraissait diff\u00e9rent. Le verre de limonade - qui \u00e9tait \u00e0 pr\u00e9sent ti\u00e8de - dont elle buvait auparavant lui sembla \u00eatre aussi haut qu'une tour et le bord de la fen\u00eatre paraissait aussi vaste qu'une autoroute. \\\\\n\nLes rayons de soleil qui per\u00e7aient la vitre \u00e9taient \u00e9blouissants et d\u00e9gageaient de la chaleur et elle fit en sorte de se mettre dans les endroits les moins intenses. \\\\\nCe qu'elle crut \u00eatre une l\u00e9g\u00e8re brise avant se transforma en un vent soufflant qui lui \u00e9bouriffa les cheveux. \\\\\n\nQuand elle se tourna pour regarder sa chambre, elle ne put pas voir grand-chose au-del\u00e0 de son vaste lit. \\\\\nL'ours en peluche qui y \u00e9tait se tenait comme une statue immense et elle abandonna l'id\u00e9e d'explorer la chambre le moment o\u00f9 elle l'eut en t\u00eate. \\\\\n\nElle voulait voir \u00e0 quoi le monde ext\u00e9rieur ressemblait et elle n'\u00e9tait pas s\u00fbre qu'elle allait pouvoir regrimper sur le bord de la fen\u00eatre plus tard si elle en descendait maintenant. \\\\\nEt donc, en se tournant vers la fen\u00eatre, elle la regarda pour voir si elle pourrait trouver le chemin le plus facile pour descendre au jardin et sa recherche fut fructueuse en peu de temps. \\\\\n\nElle marcha vers l'extr\u00e9mit\u00e9 gauche de la fen\u00eatre et testa les petites branches de la plante qui avaient grimp\u00e9 le long des murs de la maison de ses grands-parents et quand elle \u00e9tait s\u00fbre qu'elles \u00e9taient assez robustes, elle les utilisa pour descendre. \\\\\n\nL'odeur de l'herbe fra\u00eechement tondue la frappa et elle marcha \u00e0 travers le gazon en \u00e9cartant les brins d'herbe de son chemin avec ses mains. \\\\\nElle regarda \u00e0 sa droite et vit des fourmis marcher en file \u00e0 un rythme rapide. \\\\\nLa plupart des fourmis portaient une sorte de graines qui \u00e9taient deux fois plus grandes qu'elles et elle les regarda passer avec admiration. \\\\\n\nUne fois la parade de fourmis pass\u00e9e, elle reprit son chemin et l'insecte suivant qu'elle vit fut un mille-pattes. \\\\\nElle laissa \u00e9chapper un souffle effray\u00e9 car l'insecte lui parut beaucoup plus intimidant quand elle \u00e9tait aussi petite et elle d\u00e9cida de ne pas bouger et de garder le silence, faisant semblant de ne pas exister jusqu'\u00e0 ce que la voie devienne libre. \\\\\n\nQuand l'insecte ayant plus de pattes qu'elle ne put compter passa, elle reprit son chemin autour du jardin. \\\\\n\\textit{-Wow...} murmura-t-elle, impressionn\u00e9e en voyant une libellule juste avant qu'elle ne s'envole. \\\\\nElle \u00e9tait magnifique et elle se sentit chanceuse d'avoir pu la voir de si pr\u00e8s. \\\\\n\nEn allant plus loin \u00e0 travers le jardin, elle rencontra aussi une cr\u00e9ature moins jolie. \\\\\nElle fit la grimace en d\u00e9go\u00fbt alors qu'une limace passa devant elle, laissant une tra\u00een\u00e9e de bave qu'elle devait croiser pour continuer en avant. \\\\\n\n\\textit{-Il n'y a rien \u00e0 faire...} dit-elle \u00e0 elle-m\u00eame en mettant un pied au-del\u00e0 du chemin de bave apr\u00e8s l'autre. \\\\\n\nMais, tandis qu'elle \u00e9tait occup\u00e9e \u00e0 croiser sans mettre les pieds sur la substance d\u00e9go\u00fbtante, elle ne vit pas la mante religieuse g\u00e9ante qui la guettait et lorsqu'elle se tourna, elle la vit sauter sur elle. \\\\\n\nAvant qu'elle n'e\u00fbt le temps de crier, elle se trouva en l'air et quand elle regarda en haut, elle ne put voir que les grandes ailes color\u00e9es d'un papillon. \\\\\nL'insecte la d\u00e9posa sur le bord de la fen\u00eatre et inclina la t\u00eate avant de s'envoler. \\\\\n\n\\textit{-Merci de m'avoir sauv\u00e9 !} Felicity cria en agitant la main en l'air. \\\\\n\\textit{Je crois que cela me fait assez d'excitation pour aujourd'hui...} se dit-elle en glissant sur le rideau et avant de grimper sur ses draps. \\\\\n\nElle se mit sur son lit \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 de l'ours en peluche g\u00e9ant et d\u00e9cida de prendre une sieste apr\u00e8s sa marche fatigante \u00e0 travers le jardin g\u00e9ant. \\\\\nElle ferma les yeux et elle sut que lorsqu'elle les ouvrirait la

Then:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item Number of apples = \\( \\frac{1}{4}x \\)\n\\item Number of papayas = \\( \\frac{1}{3}x \\)\n\\item Number of mangos = \\( \\frac{1}{6}x \\)\n\\item Number of bananas = \\( x - \\left(\\frac{1}{4}x + \\frac{1}{3}x + \\frac{1}{6}x\\right) \\)\n\\end{itemize}\n\nTo find a common denominator, we can use 12:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item Number of apples = \\( \\frac{3}{12}x \\)\n\\item Number of papayas = \\( \\frac{4}{12}x \\)\n\\item Number of mangos = \\( \\frac{2}{12}x \\)\n\\end{itemize}\n\nAdding these fractions gives:\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{12}x + \\frac{4}{12}x + \\frac{2}{12}x = \\frac{9}{12}x\n\\]\nThus, the number of bananas is:\n\\[\nx - \\frac{9}{12}x = \\frac{3}{12}x = \\frac{1}{4}x\n\\]\n\nThe total number of fruits must be a multiple of the least common multiple of the denominators (4, 3, and 6), which is 12. Therefore, possible values for \\( x \\) could be 12, 24, 36, etc."

En todos lados hay muchas personas. Hay much\u00edsimas personas. Hay ni\u00f1os, adultos e incluso mascotas. Roc\u00edo, una de las amigas de Ariana, sabe muy bien que quiere comprar. Ella quiere comprar un vestido largo. El vestido que ella quiere comprar cuesta m\u00e1s de 200 d\u00f3lares pero hoy d\u00eda, debido a los descuentos, ese vestido ahora cuesta s\u00f3lo 50 d\u00f3lares. Por ello, Roc\u00edo va a la tienda de ropa lo m\u00e1s r\u00e1pido que puede. En realidad, ella corre hacia la tienda. Ariana y Fabiana tienen que seguirla si no quieren quedarse solas. Cuando Roc\u00edo llega a la tienda, ella ve que hay muchas personas dentro de la tienda de ropa. Ella no sabe qu\u00e9 hacer. Ella ve el vestido que quiere. El vestido que ella quiere viene en varios colores. \u00bfCu\u00e1l color le quedar\u00e1 mejor? Para saber qu\u00e9 color le queda mejor, ella se prueba todos los vestidos que hay disponibles. Fabiana y Ariana se quedan sentadas esper\u00e1ndola afuera de los probadores. Ellas no pueden creer cu\u00e1nto tiempo le toma a Roc\u00edo decidirse por un color de vestido. Al final, ella no sabe qu\u00e9 color escoger y le pregunta a sus amigas. \u00bfQu\u00e9 es lo que ellas dicen? Ellas le dicen que ella debe comprar el vestido de color azul. A ella le encanta la idea y se lo compra. Ahora s\u00f3lo falta pagar por el vestido. Felizmente, Roc\u00edo tiene su tarjeta de cr\u00e9dito. Si ella usa su tarjeta de cr\u00e9dito, ella tendr\u00e1 incluso m\u00e1s descuentos disponibles. Ariana quiere comprar un cargador de celular. \u00bfD\u00f3nde puede conseguir un cargador de celular? En la tienda de electr\u00f3nicos, \u00a1por supuesto! Como Fabiana tambi\u00e9n quiere comprar unos nuevos aud\u00edfonos, ella decide ir con ella. \u00bfQu\u00e9 hay de Roc\u00edo? Ella no quiere ir porque piensa que ir a la tienda de electr\u00f3nicos es muy aburrido. Por ello, Roc\u00edo se queda tomando un caf\u00e9 cerca de la tienda de ropa. Ariana encuentra el cargador que quiere, pero desafortunadamente, ese cargador no tiene ning\u00fan descuento. Lo bueno es que ella al menos no necesitar\u00e1 gastar mucho dinero ya que ese cargador no est\u00e1 tan caro. Fabiana, por su parte, va a buscar los aud\u00edfonos que ella quiere comprar. Ella vio los aud\u00edfonos que quiere comprar en televisi\u00f3n. Son muy caros pero ella piensa que ahora de seguro el precio habr\u00e1 bajado debido a los descuentos. Fabiana estaba en lo cierto. \u00a1Los aud\u00edfonos que ella quiere comprar no cuestan casi nada! Fabiana no lo piensa mucho y los compra de inmediato. La \u00fanica persona que no compra nada es Ariana. A pesar de que el cargador de celular que ella encontr\u00f3 es barato, ella no lo quiere comprar porque no tiene suficiente dinero. Lo bueno de tener amigas es que, a veces, ellas te ayudan si t\u00fa necesitas algo. En este caso, Ariana necesitaba dinero para comprar el cargador y sus amigas quieren ayudarla a compr\u00e1rselo.

Comme \u00e7a on aura des vitamines et on gardera de la place dans nos ventres pour les bonbons ?} \\\\\n\n\\textit{-Eh bien, ces pilules s'appellent des suppl\u00e9ments et elles ne sont utilis\u00e9es que pour t'aider.} \\\\\n\\textit{Haylee mange quand m\u00eame tous ses l\u00e9gumes et sa nourriture, n'est-ce pas ?} sa m\u00e8re r\u00e9pondit. \\\\\n\n\\textit{-Oui, je suppose...} \\\\\n\n\\textit{-Et les suppl\u00e9ments ne contiennent pas beaucoup de fibres. Les fibres sont tr\u00e8s importantes parce qu'elles aident ton ventre \u00e0 dig\u00e9rer ta nourriture.} \\\\\n\\textit{Si tu ne manges pas assez de fibres, tu peux avoir des maux d'estomac,} son p\u00e8re ajouta. \\\\\n\n\\textit{-Et m\u00eame quand tu manges ta nourriture, tu peux quand m\u00eame avoir mal au ventre en mangeant trop de bonbons et de sucreries.} \\\\\n\\textit{Tu te rappelles de la fois o\u00f9 tu avais mang\u00e9 la moiti\u00e9 du g\u00e2teau d'anniversaire de Grand-m\u00e8re ?} sa m\u00e8re demanda en arquant son sourcil. \\\\\n\nJayden fit une grimace en se rappelant du souvenir. \\\\\nNon seulement il avait eu terriblement mal au ventre, mais il avait d\u00fb boire un horrible sirop amer pour se remettre de son malaise. \\\\\n\\textit{Beurk ! Oui. Je m'en rappelle.} \\\\\n\n\\textit{-Et les bonbons te font grossir !} sa grande s\u0153ur lui dit. \\\\\n\nC'\u00e9tait la premi\u00e8re fois qu'elle avait parl\u00e9 depuis le d\u00e9but de la conversation. \\\\\nJayden fron\u00e7a ses sourcils et la regarda curieusement. \\\\\nComment \u00e9tait-il possible pour un tout petit morceau de caramel de faire grossir qui que ce soit ? \\\\\n\nIl regarda son assiette qui \u00e9tait encore \u00e0 moiti\u00e9 pleine. \\\\\nSi quelque chose avait le potentiel de faire grossir les gens, \u00e7a devrait \u00eatre les immenses quantit\u00e9s de nourriture qu'ils mangeaient \u00e0 chaque repas. \\\\\n\n\\textit{-Je crois que les p\u00e2tes et la pur\u00e9e de pommes de terre peuvent te rendre encore plus gros que les bonbons...} r\u00e9pondit-il. \\\\\n\n\\textit{-Tu as besoin de glucides et tu peux en avoir en mangeant des p\u00e2tes, des pommes de terre et du pain ainsi que des aliments semblables et ton corps prend un peu de temps pour les transformer en sucre,} \\\\\n\\textit{et donc tu ne grossis pas en les mangeant sauf si tu en manges plus que tu n'es cens\u00e9.} \\\\\n\n\\textit{Les l\u00e9gumes ne contiennent pas beaucoup de sucre, et la viande n'en contient pas du tout.} \\\\\n\\textit{Mais les bonbons sont purement faits en sucre et \u00e0 part si tu es en train de faire des activit\u00e9s qui br\u00fblent ce sucre rapidement, ton corps va le garder sous forme de gras.} \\\\\n\n\\textit{En y pensant, manger \u00e9quilibr\u00e9 t'aide \u00e0 rester en forme parce que tu remplis ton ventre avec des choses qui sont bonnes pour ton corps et tu te sens rassasi\u00e9 et du coup tu ne grignotes pas en mangeant des bonbons.} \\\\\n\nDit-elle en lui pin\u00e7ant la joue joyeusement. \\\\\n\\textit{-Je comprends que les p\u00e2tes et les pommes de terre me donnent de l'\u00e9nergie et que les l\u00e9gumes gardent mon ventre en bonne sant\u00e9, mais quel est l'int\u00e9r\u00eat de la viande ?} le petit gar\u00e7on demanda, sur un ton qui d\u00e9fia ses parents. \\\\\n\nBon, il avoua que la viande avait un bon go\u00fbt en quelque sorte, mais ce n'\u00e9tait pas mieux que les bonbons. \\\\\n\n\\textit{-La viande t'aide \u00e0 grandir.

Un moment plus tard, il se redressa pour prendre une position assise et dit \u00e0 ses amis :\\\\\n\n-- Vous vous rappelez de la f\u00eate d'anniversaire d'Aur\u00e9lie ?\\\\\n\n-- Je ne pense pas qu'on soit pr\u00eats de l'oublier de sit\u00f4t, r\u00e9pondit Capucine en posant son livre d'histoire avant de se tourner vers lui.\\\\\n\n-- C'\u00e9tait la f\u00eate la plus amusante de ma vie ! remarqua Aude avec un sourire.\\\\\n\n-- Oui ! s'\u00e9cria Marcel. Il y avait tellement de jeux ! On pouvait jouer sur le trampoline et m\u00eame aller dans la piscine !\\\\\n\n-- Et il y avait tant de bonnes choses \u00e0 manger ! ajouta Cyril avec un sourire r\u00eaveur.\\\\\n\n-- Tu parles de la pinata ou des coupes de glace ? lui demanda Aude avec un sourire taquin.\\\\\n\n-- Je pense qu'on est tous d'accord que la pizza g\u00e9ante \u00e9tait la star du buffet, dit Herv\u00e9.\\\\\n\n-- Mais j'y pense, comment fait-on une pizza aussi grande ?\\\\\n\nLes autres enfants prirent un moment pour r\u00e9fl\u00e9chir \u00e0 la question de Capucine, mais Aude fut la premi\u00e8re \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre en disant que son p\u00e8re lui avait expliqu\u00e9 que les choses g\u00e9antes \u00e9taient faites avec des pi\u00e8ces assembl\u00e9es dans une usine.\\\\\n\n-- Je suppose que c'est logique, vu que la pizza avait quatre parties avec des garnitures diff\u00e9rentes, dit Marcel en hochant la t\u00eate. Ma partie pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9e \u00e9tait celle avec la garniture poulet-champignons, miam ! Vous imaginez si on essayait d'en faire une nous-m\u00eames ? demanda Cyril avec enthousiasme.\\\\\n\n\u00c0 ces mots, les quatre autres commenc\u00e8rent \u00e0 r\u00eavasser. Ils furent transport\u00e9s de leur petite cabane en bois \u00e0 une grande usine sophistiqu\u00e9e, pleine de machines et de mat\u00e9riaux.\\\\\n\n-- On va commencer par diviser les t\u00e2ches, dit Herv\u00e9. Capucine et Cyril feront la p\u00e2te, Aude et Marcel pr\u00e9pareront la sauce, et moi, je r\u00e2perai le fromage. Quand on aura fini, on laissera lever les quartiers de p\u00e2te, puis on fera cuire les diff\u00e9rentes garnitures, assemblera la pizza, mettra la sauce, la garniture et le fromage, et cuira chaque partie dans un four diff\u00e9rent. Une fois toutes les parties pr\u00eates, on assemble le tout !\\\\\n\nLes autres accept\u00e8rent le plan d'Herv\u00e9, sauf Cyril, qui leva la main et dit :\\\\\n\n-- Je voudrais r\u00e2per le fromage \u00e0 ta place, et toi, tu peux faire la p\u00e2te avec Capucine.\\\\\n\n-- Pas question ! dit Aude. Tu mangerais la moiti\u00e9 du fromage si on te laissait faire.\\\\\n\nHerv\u00e9, Capucine et Marcel rirent tandis que Cyril boudait en murmurant que ce n'\u00e9tait pas juste. Les cinq mirent des tabliers, des gants et des coiffes de cuisinier, puis se dispers\u00e8rent chacun dans leur coin.\\\\\n\nCapucine demanda \u00e0 Cyril de lui chercher la farine et la levure pendant qu'elle chauffait un peu d'eau. Elle versa la levure dans l'eau ti\u00e8de avec un peu de sucre tandis que Cyril lui ramena l'huile et le sel.\\\\\n\n-- H\u00e9, Capucine, regarde ! dit Cyril avant de lui mettre de la farine sur le nez lorsqu'elle releva la t\u00eate pour le regarder.\\\\\n\n-- H\u00e9 !!!\\\\\n\nElle lui rendit la pareille, et les deux \u00e9clat\u00e8rent de rire avant de se remettre au travail. Ils mirent les ingr\u00e9dients dans le p\u00e9trin, puis pos\u00e8rent le bol pr\u00e8s du four pr\u00e9chauff\u00e9.\\\\\n\nPendant ce temps, Aude et Marcel pr\u00e9paraient la sauce.\\\\\n\n-- Pourquoi on doit y mettre du sucre ? demanda Marcel.\\\\\n\n-- Pour neutraliser l'acidit\u00e9 de la tomate, r\u00e9pondit la fillette.\\\\\n\n-- Est-ce qu'on a vraiment besoin de toutes ces \u00e9pices ?\\\\\n\n-- Oui, c'est ce qui donne un bon go\u00fbt \u00e0 la sauce.\\\\\n\n-- On peut se passer de l'ail, tu ne crois pas ? dit Marcel avec un air incertain.\\\\\n\nAude le regarda, puis regarda la grande marmite contenant la sauce.\\\\\n\n-- Tu n'aimes pas l'ail ?\\\\\n\n-- Non, je trouve \u00e7a un peu fort.\\\\\n\nIls \u00e9chang\u00e8rent un regard complice, et Aude haussa les \u00e9paules avant de poser l'ail sur la table.\\\\\n\n-- \u00c7a ne fera de mal \u00e0 personne s'il manque un ingr\u00e9dient, hein ? dit-elle avec un sourire.\\\\\n\n-- Personne n'a besoin de savoir qu'il manque un ingr\u00e9dient d'ailleurs, r\u00e9pondit Marcel.\\\\\n\nIls se serr\u00e8rent la main puis continu\u00e8rent leur travail : Aude ajoutait les ingr\u00e9dients tandis que Marcel remuait la sauce sur le feu.\\\\\n\nDe l'autre c\u00f4t\u00e9 de l'usine, Herv\u00e9 r\u00e2pait le fromage et, un peu comme Cyril l'aurait fait, prit soin de le go\u00fbter.\\\\\n\n-- Juste pour v\u00e9rifier si c'est de la bonne qualit\u00e9\u2026 se dit-il.\\\\\n\nLorsque toutes les t\u00e2ches principales furent accomplies, le groupe d'enfants passa \u00e0 la cuisson des garnitures. Cyril insista pour une partie poulet-champignons, Aude et Capucine voulaient des poivrons et du pepperoni, Herv\u00e9 opta pour une garniture italienne avec basilic, olives et mozzarella, et Marcel surprit tout le monde en choisissant de mettre de l'ananas dans une partie.\\\\\n\n-- \u00c0 chacun sa tasse ! dit-il.\\\\\n\nIls firent cuire le tout avant de mettre la sauce, la garniture et le fromage sur les quartiers de p\u00e2te, puis transf\u00e9r\u00e8rent les morceaux au four sur un grand chariot. Lorsqu'une d\u00e9licieuse odeur emplit l'usine, indiquant que les parties de pizza \u00e9taient pr\u00eates, ils les sortirent prudemment, les mirent un \u00e0 un sur un grand plan de travail, puis les pouss\u00e8rent c\u00f4te \u00e0 c\u00f4te pour former un grand disque de pizza.\\\\\n\nIls se regard\u00e8rent, fatigu\u00e9s, souriants, et surtout fiers de leur travail.\\\\\n\n-- Qui a faim ?\\\\\n\nUne voix m\u00e9lodieuse interrompit le r\u00eave \u00e9veill\u00e9 des cinq enfants. Herv\u00e9 se tourna vers sa m\u00e8re, perch\u00e9e sur l'escalier de la cabane.\\\\\n\n-- \u00c7a vous dit d'aller manger au resto rapide ? leur demanda-t-elle.\\\\\n\nLes cinq amis accept\u00e8rent l'offre avec enthousiasme et lui dirent qu'ils savaient d\u00e9j\u00e0 ce qu'ils voulaient : une pizza !\\\\\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item Qui est l'amie qui offrit de la pizza g\u00e9ante dans sa f\u00eate d'anniversaire ?\n    \\begin{enumerate}\n        \\item[A.] Annabelle\n        \\item[B.] Am\u00e9lie\n        \\item[C.] Aur\u00e9lie\n        \\item[D.] Alison\n    \\end{enumerate}\n\n    \\item Selon Aude, la pizza g\u00e9ante \u00e9tait faite dans... ?\n    \\begin{enumerate}\n        \\item[A.] Une ferme\n        \\item[B.] Une usine\n        \\item[C.] Une for\u00eat\n        \\item[D.] Un restaurant\n    \\end{enumerate}\n\n    \\item Qui est-ce qui allait r\u00e2per le fromage ?\n    \\begin{enumerate}\n        \\item[A.] Cyril\n        \\item[B.] Aude\n        \\item[C.] Capucine\n        \\item[D.] Herv\u00e9\n    \\end{enumerate}\n\n    \\item Quel ingr\u00e9dient avait \u00e9t\u00e9 n\u00e9glig\u00e9 par Aude et Marcel ?\n    \\begin{enumerate}\n        \\item[A.] Le poivre\n        \\item[B.] Le sel\n        \\item[C.] La tomate\n        \\item[D.] L'ail\n    \\end{enumerate}\n\n    \\item Quel ingr\u00e9dient voulait Marcel inclure dans sa garniture de pizza ?\n    \\begin{enumerate}\n        \\item[A.] Les anchois\n        \\item[B.] Le basilic\n        \\item[C.] L'ananas\n        \\item[D.] Le thon\n    \\end{enumerate}\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\\subsection*{Answers}\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item C\n    \\item B\n    \\item D\n    \\item D\n    \\item C\n\\end{enumerate}"

Ou plut\u00f4t, qui aurait vu ses expressions. \\\\\n\nLa raison pour laquelle Cindy faisait la t\u00eate \u00e9tait assez simple : elle \u00e9tait frustr\u00e9e car elle avait eu une tr\u00e8s bonne id\u00e9e \u2014 ou, du moins, elle avait cru que c'\u00e9tait le cas \u2014 qui avait mal tourn\u00e9 quand elle avait essay\u00e9 de l'ex\u00e9cuter. \\\\\nSon id\u00e9e n'\u00e9tait pas quelque chose de vraiment compliqu\u00e9. C'\u00e9tait m\u00eame une id\u00e9e tr\u00e8s simple. \\\\\nElle avait pens\u00e9 que si elle nouait ses lacets et courait \u00e0 travers son jardin, elle pourrait s'entra\u00eener seule pour la course \u00e0 trois jambes de son \u00e9cole. \\\\\nMalheureusement, son id\u00e9e \u00e9choua et quand elle tenta de prendre le premier pas, elle finit par tomber. \\\\\nSes coudes \u00e9taient \u00e9gratign\u00e9s et sa fiert\u00e9 \u00e9tait touch\u00e9e par l'\u00e9chec de l'id\u00e9e qu'elle avait cru \u00eatre brillante. \\\\\nQuelle honte ! \\\\\n\n\\textit{-\u00c7a aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 super si les id\u00e9es pouvaient nous pr\u00e9venir d'avance et nous dire si elles sont de bonnes ou de mauvaises id\u00e9es...} murmura-t-elle \u00e0 elle-m\u00eame avec un soupir malheureux. \\\\\nSelon elle, cela l'aurait \u00e9pargn\u00e9e. Ou du moins, ses coudes auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9pargn\u00e9s. \\\\\n\nElle commen\u00e7a \u00e0 r\u00eavasser en pensant \u00e0 cette id\u00e9e. \\\\\n\\textit{-Si ma mauvaise id\u00e9e \u00e9tait devenue une personne pour me pr\u00e9venir en avance, elle aurait eu une apparence affreuse...} dit-elle en imaginant une petite version d'elle-m\u00eame habill\u00e9e en pyjama sale. \\\\\nLa \"mauvaise\" id\u00e9e avait les cheveux en l'air et du sable dans les yeux, n'ayant clairement pas fait sa toilette du matin. \\\\\n\n\\textit{-Je parie que tu ne t'es m\u00eame pas bross\u00e9e les dents...} Cindy lui dit. \\\\\n\\textit{-Pourquoi faire ? Je ne vais rien accomplir de toute fa\u00e7on.} La petite id\u00e9e-Cindy r\u00e9pondit en baillant. \\\\\n\\textit{-Beurk ! J'avais raison, tu as une haleine de chacal !} Cindy l'accusa en agitant sa main devant son nez. \\\\\n\nL'id\u00e9e sourit et agita la main avec audace avant de dispara\u00eetre. \\\\\n\\textit{-Ce n'est pas \u00e9tonnant qu'elle ait \u00e9chou\u00e9,} pensa-t-elle. \\textit{J'aurais pu deviner si j'avais vu \u00e0 quoi elle ressemblait...} \\\\\n\nAvec un soupir, elle d\u00e9cida de se d\u00e9gourdir les jambes et se leva pour le faire. \\\\\nEn descendant les marches, elle pensa \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re personne qui avait pens\u00e9 \u00e0 les construire. \\\\\nElle ne connaissait pas qui avait invent\u00e9 les marches et donc elle imagina que c'\u00e9tait elle, et une petite vision d'elle apparut devant elle. \\\\\n\n\\textit{-Salut, petite moi !} salua-t-elle. \\\\\nLa petite id\u00e9e avait une belle apparence. Elle \u00e9tait habill\u00e9e convenablement mais ses v\u00eatements n'\u00e9taient pas tr\u00e8s sophistiqu\u00e9s, c'\u00e9tait seulement une salopette en jean avec un T-shirt en coton en dessous. \\\\\nElle \u00e9tait propre et ses cheveux \u00e9taient bross\u00e9s et tenus en queue de cheval. \\\\\nElle sourit timidement et fit un signe de la main en guise de salut. \\\\\n\n\\textit{-La conception des marches \u00e9tait une id\u00e9e simple mais tr\u00e8s bonne. Cela a permis aux gens de monter \u00e0 de hauts endroits apr\u00e8s qu'ils avaient eu des difficult\u00e9s avec les pentes raides,} l'id\u00e9e l'informa avec un sourire confiant. \\\\\nCindy hocha la t\u00eate. \\\\\n\\textit{-C'\u00e9tait s\u00fbrement une bonne id\u00e9e vu qu'on l'utilise jusqu'\u00e0 ce jour.} \\\\\n\nUne autre id\u00e9e apparut devant elle et s'\u00e9claircit la gorge. \\\\\n\\textit{-L'ascenseur \u00e9tait une id\u00e9e encore meilleure,} dit-elle avec une expression hautaine. \\\\\nCelle-ci \u00e9tait habill\u00e9e en costume parfaitement repass\u00e9 et portait des lunettes. \\\\\nSes cheveux \u00e9taient coiff\u00e9s en un chignon qui rappela \u00e0 Cindy la directrice de son \u00e9cole. \\\\\n\\textit{-Tr\u00e8s pratique pour les gens avec des handicaps et permet de gagner du temps. D'ailleurs, les gens n'ont qu'\u00e0 appuyer sur quelques boutons,} l'id\u00e9e ajouta. \\\\\n\nAvant que Cindy n'e\u00fbt le temps de r\u00e9pondre, l'id\u00e9e-escalier prit la parole. \\\\\n\\textit{-Oui, m-mais inutile sans \u00e9lectricit\u00e9,} elle argumenta en levant son index. \\\\\nL'id\u00e9e-ascenseur laissa \u00e9chapper un souffle et parut tr\u00e8s offens\u00e9e. \\\\\n\\textit{-De nos jours, les coupures de courant sont tr\u00e8s rares,} r\u00e9pondit-elle en croisant les bras. \\\\\n\n\\textit{-Pas aussi rares que \u00e7a dans certains pays. Je suis s\u00fbre qu'ils sont contents d'avoir des escaliers.} Telle \u00e9tait la r\u00e9ponse de l'id\u00e9e-escalier. \\\\\nCindy rigola en regardant les deux id\u00e9es se chamailler sur laquelle d'entre elles \u00e9tait la plus r\u00e9volutionnaire jusqu'\u00e0 ce que les deux disparurent avec un son de \"pouf\" en laissant un nuage de poussi\u00e8re color\u00e9e derri\u00e8re elles. \\\\\n\nElle continua \u00e0 marcher sans destination en t\u00eate \u00e0 travers le jardin et s'arr\u00eata quand elle vit un nain de jardin. \\\\\nCindy inclina la t\u00eate sur le c\u00f4t\u00e9 et le regarda avec confusion. \\\\\nC'\u00e9tait l'une des id\u00e9es dont elle ne pouvait pas se r\u00e9signer. \u00c0 quoi pensait la personne qui les avait invent\u00e9s ? \\\\\n\nSoudain, une autre id\u00e9e apparut devant elle. Celle-l\u00e0 portait une jupe, un tricot en laine et une paire de mocassins. \\\\\nSes cheveux \u00e9taient en cascade et elle regarda autour d'elle, distraite par son entourage. \\\\\n\\textit{-Salut...?} Cindy la salua avec h\u00e9sitation. \\\\\n\\textit{-Es-tu cens\u00e9e \u00eatre une bonne ou mauvaise id\u00e9e ?} \\\\\n\nL'id\u00e9e haussa ses \u00e9paules et sourit. \\\\\n\\textit{-Je suis l'id\u00e9e-naine-de-jardin. Je n'\u00e9tais qu'une pens\u00e9e impulsive, rien de trop sophistiqu\u00e9.} \\\\\n\\textit{-Eh bien, comment celui qui t'a invent\u00e9e a su que tu allais devenir populaire ?} Cindy demanda. \\\\\n\nL'id\u00e9e sourit et secoua la t\u00eate. \\\\\n\\textit{-Il ne le savait pas.

Anstatt einige seiner Kollegen oder jemanden aus seiner Familie auszuw\u00e4hlen, entschied er sich, etwas Ungew\u00f6hnliches zu tun. Er lud alle potenziellen Kandidaten, Finanzdirektoren, Abteilungsleiter, Kassierer, Berater, ein und gab ihnen die folgende Rede:\\\\\n\\textit{One successful businessman was getting older and realized that someone should replace him. Instead of choosing some of his colleagues or someone from his family, he decided to do something unusual. He invited all potential candidates, financial directors, chiefs of departments, cashiers, and advisors and gave them the following speech:}\\\\\n\n\"Liebe Freunde, es ist Zeit f\u00fcr mich, mein Gesch\u00e4ft zu beenden und in einen verdienten Ruhestand zu gehen. Au\u00dferdem ist es jetzt die beste Zeit, einen neuen Gesch\u00e4ftsf\u00fchrer auszuw\u00e4hlen, der unser Unternehmen in Zukunft leiten wird ...

I want all of you to plant it and water it and we will gather again next year to see what you did with it. Then I will decide who will be the new manager. \"}\\\\\n\nJim war auch bei diesem Treffen dabei, und wie auch alle anderen die anwesend waren, bekam er einen Samen. Als er nach Hause kam, teilte er die Nachricht mit seiner Frau und sie beschlossen, den Samen zu n\u00e4hren, aus dem die Pflanze wachsen w\u00fcrde. Sie fanden einen sch\u00f6nen Topf, legten den D\u00fcnger und einen Thermometer ein, haben ein paar B\u00fccher \u00fcber Pflanzenanbau gelesen und fuhren mit ihrem Leben fort. Jeden Tag gingen sie zu dem Topf und warteten gespannt darauf, dass etwas auftaucht.\\\\\n\\textit{Jim was also at this meeting, and as everyone else present, he got the seed, too. When he arrived home, he shared the message with his wife and they decided to nurture the seed from which the plant would grow. They found a nice pot, put the fertilizer, took a thermometer, read a few books on plant cultivation, and continued with their lives. Every day they went to the pot and eagerly waited for something to emerge.}\\\\ \n\nNach 14 Tagen haben einige von Jims Kollegen bereits angefangen, \u00fcber ihre wachsenden Pflanzen zu sprechen. Und Jim beobachtete den Topf jeden Tag mit seiner Frau, aber nichts passierte. Es ist \u00fcber ein Monat vergangen und nichts ist passiert. \u00dcber die Pflanzen wurde schon viel diskutiert.\\\\ \n\\textit{After 14 days, some of Jim's colleagues had already started talking about their growing plants. And Jim watched with his wife every day, but nothing happened. It had been over a month and nothing happened. There had already been a lot of discussion about the plants.}\\\\ \n\nZur Mittagszeit tauschten sie praktische Ideen \u00fcber schnellen Wachstum aus, und Jim erkannte, dass er als einziger keinen Erfolg hatte.\\\\ \n\\textit{At lunch-time, they exchanged practical ideas of rapid growth, and Jim realized that he was alone with nothing and that he was unsuccessful.}\\\\ \n\nSechs Monate sp\u00e4ter, und es gab immer noch keine Fortschritte. Er begann zu glauben, dass er einen Fehler gemacht hatte. Vielleicht zu viel Wasser oder schlechter D\u00fcnger oder etwas anderes, das er nicht erkl\u00e4ren konnte. Er wusste, dass er sein Bestes gab und es tat ihm leid, dass er keine Ergebnisse hatte.\\\\ \n\\textit{Six months later, and there was still no progress. He began to believe that he had made a mistake. Maybe too much water or bad fertilizer or something else that he could not explain. He knew he did the best he could and was sorry he had no results.}\\\\ \n\nDas Jahr ging bald zu Ende, und die jungen Bosse versammelten sich mit ihren Pflanzen, um den Gesch\u00e4ftsf\u00fchrer zu treffen. Jim sagte seiner Frau, dass er den leeren Topf nicht mitnehmen w\u00fcrde, aber sie schaffte es, ihn zu \u00fcberreden, um den Manager zu erz\u00e4hlen, was passiert war. Er war sehr nerv\u00f6s.\\\\ \n\\textit{The year soon came to an end, and the young bosses gathered together with their plants to meet the general manager. Jim told his wife that he would not take the empty pot, but she, however, managed to persuade him, telling him to tell the manager fairly what had happened. He was very nervous.}\\\\ \n\nEr dachte, dass dies der unangenehmste Moment f\u00fcr ihn im Leben sein wird. Trotzdem wusste sie, dass sie Recht hatte und war fest davon \u00fcberzeugt, dass er nichts falsch gemacht hatte. Er nahm seinen Topf mit in den Besprechungsraum. Er sah wundersch\u00f6ne Pflanzen auf dem Tisch. Sie waren alle gro\u00df und ausgewachsen.\\\\ \n\\textit{He thought that this would be the most unpleasant moment for him in life. Still, she knew she was right and was firmly convinced that there was nothing he did wrong. He took his pot in the meeting room. He saw beautiful plants on the table. They were all big and fully grown.}\\\\ \n\nEr stellte seinen leeren Topf auf den Boden, w\u00e4hrend andere lachten. Als der Gesch\u00e4ftsf\u00fchrer ankam, schaute er durch alle Pflanzen und begr\u00fc\u00dfte die Kandidaten. Jim versuchte, so weit von ihm entfernt zu sein, damit er es nicht sehen w\u00fcrde.\\\\ \n\\textit{He put his empty pot on the floor, while others were laughing. When the general manager arrived, he looked through all the plants and greeted the candidates. Jim tried to be as far away from him, so that he would not see it.}\\\\ \n\n\"Wie sch\u00f6n!\" sagte der Gesch\u00e4ftsf\u00fchrer. \"Ich sehe, dass es jetzt nicht einfach sein wird, einen neuen Manager auszuw\u00e4hlen ...\" Und in diesem Moment sah er den leeren Topf. Er hat den Vizepr\u00e4sidenten gebeten, ihn zu nehmen und den Eigent\u00fcmer zu ihm zu bringen. Jim trat heraus.\\\\ \n\\textit{\"How beautiful!\" the general manager said. \"I see that it will not be easy to pick a new manager now ...\" And, at that moment, he saw the empty pot. He asked the vice president to take it and bring the owner to him. Jim stepped out.}\\\\ \n\n\"Oh Gott ... Vielleicht werde ich jetzt rausgeschmissen\", dachte er.\\\\ \n\\textit{\"Oh God ... Maybe I'll get kicked out of the company now,\" he thought.}\\\\ \n\nAls er kam, fragte ihn der Manager, was mit seinem Samen passierte. Und Jim war ganz ehrlich und er entschuldigte sich. Der Manager bat dann alle sich zu sitzen - au\u00dfer Jim. Er sah sie an und sagte:\\\\ \n\\textit{When he came, the general manager asked him what happened to his seed. And Jim was all honest and he apologized. The general manager then asked everyone to sit - except for Jim. He looked at them and said:}\\\\ \n\n\"Jim, ich bin sehr stolz auf dich ... Jim ist der neue CEO der Firma!\"\\\\ \n\\textit{\"Jim, I'm very proud of you. Jim is the new CEO of the company!\"}\\\\ \n\n\"Nun ... wie ist das m\u00f6glich? Mein Topf ist leer ...\", fragte Jim verwirrt.\\\\ \n\\textit{\"Well ... how is that possible? My pot is empty. \" Jim asked confused.}\\\\ \n\nDer alte Manager erkl\u00e4rte: \"Vor einem Jahr gab ich jedem von euch einen toten Samen. Es war unm\u00f6glich, dass etwas daraus w\u00e4chst. Jeder von euch, der sah, dass nichts passierte, beschloss es durch gesunde Samen zu ersetzen. Jeder von euch - Au\u00dfer Jim. Ihr alle habt mir Pflanzen und Blumen gebracht. Nur Jim war stolz auf das Versagen und hatte genug Mut und Ehrlichkeit, mir einen leeren Topf zu bringen. Ihr wolltet Erfolg - um jeden Preis, und Jims Ehrlichkeit war wichtiger als Erfolg. Deshalb ist er heute der CEO ... \"\\\\ \n\\textit{The old general manager explained: \"One year ago I gave each of you a dead seed. It was impossible that something could grow out of it. Each of you, seeing nothing to grow, decided to replace it with healthy seeds. Each of you - except Jim. You all brought me plants and flowers. Only Jim was proud of the failure and had enough courage and honesty to bring me an empty seed. You all wanted success - at all cost, and Jim's honesty was more important than success. That is why he is the CEO today. \"}\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item Warum musste der Gesch\u00e4ftsf\u00fchrer einen neuen Manager ausw\u00e4hlen?\n\\item Wie hei\u00dft der Mitarbeiter mit dem leeren Topf?\n\\item Was gab der Gesch\u00e4ftsf\u00fchrer den Mitarbeitern?\n\\item Wie lange mussten sich die Mitarbeiter um den Samen k\u00fcmmern?\n\\item Wer hat Jim geholfen?\n\\item Wo hat Jim den Samen aufbewahrt?\n    \\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item in dem K\u00fchlschrank\n    \\item unter dem Kissen\n    \\item in einem Topf\n    \\end{enumerate}\n\\item Warum war Jim nerv\u00f6s?\n    \\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item weil er den Samen verloren hat\n    \\item weil jemand den Samen geklaut hat\n    \\item weil der Samen nicht gewachsen ist\n    \\end{enumerate}\n\\item Wie sahen die Samen von den anderen nach einem Jahr aus?\n    \\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item jeder hat einen leeren Topf mitgebracht\n    \\item jeder andere hatte eine sch\u00f6ne Pflanze\n    \\item die Samen waren tot\n    \\end{enumerate}\n\\item Wer wurde der neue Gesch\u00e4ftsf\u00fchrer?\n    \\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item Jim\n    \\item Jim's Frau\n    \\item ein anderer Mitarbeiter\n    \\end{enumerate}\n\\item Warum war Jims Topf leer?\n    \\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item weil der Samen tot war\n    \\item weil Jim den Samen verloren hat\n    \\item weil er sich nicht um den Samen gut gek\u00fcmmert hat\n    \\end{enumerate}\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\\subsection*{Answers}\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item Weil er in Rente gehen wollte.\n\\item Jim\n\\item Einen Samen\n\\item Ein Jahr lang.\n\\item Seine Frau\n\\item 3\n\\item 3\n\\item 3\n\\item 2\n\\item 1\n\\end{enumerate}"

Tout avait l'air r\u00e9el, du nom peint sur le c\u00f4t\u00e9 du bateau au nid de pie sur le point le plus haut. \\\\\n\n\\textit{-Alors... vous savez comment \u00e7a a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait ?} demanda-t-elle curieusement au propri\u00e9taire de la boutique en lui repassant le pr\u00e9cieux objet. \\\\\nLe vieil homme hocha la t\u00eate et se tourna vers elle apr\u00e8s avoir remis la bouteille \u00e0 sa place. \\\\\n\n\\textit{-Certains croient qu'il y a longtemps de cela, quand les marins oubliaient leurs bouteilles ouvertes avant de s'endormir, de toutes petites cr\u00e9atures sortaient de leurs cachettes et construisaient des bateaux qui flottaient sur le liquide qui \u00e9tait dans la bouteille.} \\\\\n\\textit{Quand le liquide s\u00e9chait au lever du jour, les cr\u00e9atures disparaissaient apr\u00e8s avoir fini leur t\u00e2che et seul le bateau restait dans la bouteille, la rendant inutilisable.} \\\\\n\n\\textit{Les marins n'avaient pas d'autres choix que de garder les bateaux en bouteilles pour d\u00e9corer ou les vendre aux touristes.} \\\\\n\n\u00c9merveill\u00e9e par la l\u00e9gende, Aria ne dit rien \u00e0 travers le r\u00e9cit du vieux vendeur. \\\\\n\n\\textit{-Cependant,} le vieil homme reprit la parole. \\\\\n\\textit{-Les humains commenc\u00e8rent \u00e0 copier le travail des minuscules \u00eatres et commenc\u00e8rent \u00e0 cr\u00e9er ces mod\u00e8les eux-m\u00eames.} \\\\\n\n\\textit{D'ailleurs,} dit-il en regardant son grand-p\u00e8re. \\\\\n\\textit{-Ton vieillard sait comment les fabriquer. Tous ces mod\u00e8les ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faits par ton grand-p\u00e8re !} \\\\\n\nAria laissa \u00e9chapper un souffle et tourna la t\u00eate pour faire face \u00e0 son grand-p\u00e8re. \\\\\n\\textit{-Vraiment ?} murmura-t-elle. \\\\\n\nGrand-p\u00e8re rigola et la serra contre lui. \\\\\n\\textit{-En effet. On peut en faire un quand on rentre \u00e0 la maison si tu veux,} lui dit-il. \\\\\n\\textit{-Oui, s'il te pla\u00eet !} dit-elle avec grand enthousiasme. \\\\\n\nTenant sa parole, lorsqu'ils retourn\u00e8rent chez lui, grand-p\u00e8re ramena du bois, du papier, de la colle et d'autres mat\u00e9riaux dont ils avaient besoin pour faire le mod\u00e8le. \\\\\n\\textit{-Tout d'abord, on va construire la base du bateau,} son grand-p\u00e8re lui dit en prenant un morceau de bois et en commen\u00e7ant \u00e0 le sculpter avant de le peindre en marron fonc\u00e9. \\\\\n\n\\textit{-Puis, on commence par le glisser \u00e0 l'int\u00e9rieur de la bouteille. On va monter les diff\u00e9rentes pi\u00e8ces du bateau \u00e0 l'int\u00e9rieur de la bouteille.} \\\\\nIl fit cela avant de demander \u00e0 sa petite fille de dessiner des formes de voiles sur le papier. \\\\\n\n\\textit{-Maintenant, coupe-les pendant que je noue le fil qui va servir de cordes \u00e0 la base du bateau.} \\\\\n\nLes deux travaill\u00e8rent en silence, chacun plong\u00e9 dans sa t\u00e2che et quand il \u00e9tait temps pour la touche finale, grand-p\u00e8re utilisa deux longs crochets en m\u00e9tal pour tirer les fils qui \u00e9taient nou\u00e9s aux voiles et en tirant rapidement sur eux, les voiles s'\u00e9tendirent et l'\u0153uvre fut termin\u00e9e. \\\\\n\n\\textit{-Juste un dernier petit d\u00e9tail,} dit-il en lui passant le bouchon en li\u00e8ge. \\\\\n\\textit{-Tu veux bien ?} \\\\\n\n\\textit{-Avec plaisir !} Aria prit la pi\u00e8ce en bois dans sa main et l'ins\u00e9ra dans l'ouverture de la bouteille en verre. \\\\\n\\textit{-Voil\u00e0.

Celle-ci avait choisi un itin\u00e9raire assez facile pour les tout-petits et marchait \u00e0 un rythme lent pour ne pas les fatiguer.\\\\\n\n-- Zo\u00e9 ? Cl\u00e9ment, un des petits gar\u00e7ons qui marchaient en queue, appela sa s\u0153ur.\\\\\n\n-- Oui ? r\u00e9pondit son a\u00een\u00e9e.\\\\\n\nZo\u00e9 trouvait l'activit\u00e9 \u00e0 son go\u00fbt. Depuis toute petite, elle aimait marcher, courir et sauter. C'\u00e9tait une fillette tr\u00e8s active, contrairement \u00e0 son petit fr\u00e8re g\u00e2t\u00e9 qui pr\u00e9f\u00e9rait se faire porter.\\\\\n\n-- J'ai faim. Quand est-ce qu'on va manger ? demanda-t-il.\\\\\n\n-- On mangera quand on arrivera aux chalets. Mademoiselle Ludivine nous l'a d\u00e9j\u00e0 dit.\\\\\n\n-- Mais j...\\\\\n\nAvant qu'il ne puisse finir sa phrase, Cl\u00e9ment tr\u00e9bucha sur une pierre et tomba. Il se redressa mais resta agenouill\u00e9, g\u00e9missant de douleur en s'essuyant le visage. Zo\u00e9, exasp\u00e9r\u00e9e par son petit fr\u00e8re \u00e9tourdi, soupira et s'arr\u00eata pour l'aider.\\\\\n\n-- Tu es tomb\u00e9 parce que tes lacets sont d\u00e9faits. Regarde ! dit-elle en indiquant ses chaussures d'un mouvement de t\u00eate.\\\\\n\n-- Ah ! Une minute, je vais les refaire !\\\\\n\nDistrait, Cl\u00e9ment cessa de pleurer et se concentra sur ses lacets, mais apr\u00e8s plusieurs tentatives infructueuses, sa grande s\u0153ur perdit patience. Elle s'accroupit pour les refaire elle-m\u00eame.\\\\\n\n-- Laisse-moi faire, sinon on y passera la journ\u00e9e, dit-elle.\\\\\n\nUne fois ses chaussures s\u00e9curis\u00e9es, Cl\u00e9ment et sa s\u0153ur reprirent leur route pour rejoindre les autres. Mais apr\u00e8s une bonne dizaine de minutes, ils r\u00e9alis\u00e8rent qu'ils s'\u00e9taient s\u00e9par\u00e9s du groupe.\\\\\n\n-- Ah ! Ils ont avanc\u00e9 dr\u00f4lement vite, dis donc ! remarqua Zo\u00e9.\\\\\n\nLes deux continu\u00e8rent \u00e0 marcher jusqu'\u00e0 une bifurcation.\\\\\n\n-- Tu crois qu'ils sont partis par o\u00f9 ? demanda Cl\u00e9ment.\\\\\n\n-- Je n'en sais rien. Mais on doit choisir.\\\\\n\n-- Je vais le faire ! r\u00e9pondit son fr\u00e8re.\\\\\n\n\\textit{Am stram gram, pique et pique et col\u00e9gram, bourre et bourre et ratatam, am stram gram !}\\\\\n\nIl chanta en pointant le doigt sur les deux chemins, puis d\u00e9clara qu'ils iraient \u00e0 gauche. Zo\u00e9 accepta, et ils se remirent en route. En chemin, Cl\u00e9ment se plaignit de la chaleur, de la fatigue et de la faim. Zo\u00e9, l'ignorant, lui tendit sa gourde.\\\\\n\n-- Bois un peu d'eau, dit-elle.\\\\\n\nIls march\u00e8rent en silence avant que Cl\u00e9ment demande \u00e0 nouveau quand ils arriveraient.\\\\\n\n-- Je n'en sais pas plus que toi, Cl\u00e9ment ! r\u00e9pondit-elle. D'ailleurs, je crois que nous sommes perdus...\\\\\n\nCl\u00e9ment, tentant de garder son calme, se rassura en pensant que sa grande s\u0153ur, courageuse et intelligente, trouverait une solution.\\\\\n\n-- Qu'est-ce qu'on va faire maintenant ? demanda-t-il.\\\\\n\n-- Peut-\u00eatre qu'on doit rester ici et attendre qu'on nous envoie de l'aide. Mademoiselle Ludivine finira par se rendre compte de notre absence t\u00f4t ou tard... dit Zo\u00e9 avec incertitude.\\\\\n\nD\u00e9sirant aider, Cl\u00e9ment lui sugg\u00e9ra quelques solutions.\\\\\n\n-- Peut-\u00eatre qu'on devrait grimper sur l'arbre le plus haut pour rep\u00e9rer le camp.\\\\\n\n-- Ce serait trop dangereux, soupira Zo\u00e9.\\\\\n\n-- Alors, on peut continuer \u00e0 marcher jusqu'au sommet de la montagne.\\\\\n\n-- On ne sait m\u00eame pas quel chemin prendre pour atteindre le sommet...\\\\\n\n-- On peut --\\\\\n\n-- Non, Cl\u00e9ment ! On ne peut rien faire ! Arr\u00eate de m'agacer ! On va rester ici et attendre que quelqu'un vienne pour nous ! cria Zo\u00e9, \u00e0 bout de patience.\\\\\n\nVex\u00e9 par le ton de sa s\u0153ur, Cl\u00e9ment commen\u00e7a \u00e0 pleurer. Zo\u00e9, regrettant son \u00e9clat de col\u00e8re, le prit dans ses bras pour s'excuser.\\\\\n\n-- Allez, viens, on va manger. Je sais que tu as faim, lui dit-elle en le menant vers une souche.\\\\\n\nLes deux sortirent leurs bo\u00eetes \u00e0 lunch et commenc\u00e8rent \u00e0 manger. Au bout d'un moment, Cl\u00e9ment aper\u00e7ut un \u00e9cureuil qui les guettait depuis un arbre.\\\\\n\n-- Je crois qu'il a faim, dit Zo\u00e9.\\\\\n\n-- Maman nous a mis de la tarte aux noix de p\u00e9can, tu veux lui en offrir un peu ?\\\\\n\nCl\u00e9ment, enthousiaste, prit un morceau de tarte et s'approcha doucement de l'animal, qui commen\u00e7a \u00e0 manger dans sa main. Quand tous furent rassasi\u00e9s, une voix les surprit :\\\\\n\n-- Vous \u00eates perdus, n'est-ce pas ?\\\\\n\nZo\u00e9 et Cl\u00e9ment regard\u00e8rent autour d'eux jusqu'\u00e0 ce que la voix leur dise de regarder en bas. Bouche b\u00e9e, ils r\u00e9alis\u00e8rent qu'elle venait de l'\u00e9cureuil.\\\\\n\n-- I-i-il parle ! cria Cl\u00e9ment.\\\\\n\n-- C'est exact, dit l'\u00e9cureuil avec un petit sourire espi\u00e8gle.\\\\\n\n-- Z-Z-Zo\u00e9 ! Il parle ! balbutia Cl\u00e9ment, tournant vers sa s\u0153ur p\u00e9trifi\u00e9e.\\\\\n\nL'\u00e9cureuil l\u00e2cha un soupir, plus ennuy\u00e9 qu'amus\u00e9 maintenant.\\\\\n\n-- Mais \u00e9videmment que je parle. Tout le monde parle dans le bois enchant\u00e9 !\\\\\n\nCela fit enfin sortir Zo\u00e9 de son \u00e9tat de transe.\\\\\n\n-- Le bois enchant\u00e9 ? r\u00e9p\u00e9ta-t-elle.\\\\\n\n-- Comme je viens de le dire, r\u00e9torqua l'animal. Mais j'y pense, je ne me suis pas encore pr\u00e9sent\u00e9. Je m'appelle F\u00e9lix. F\u00e9lix DuBois, ajouta-t-il.\\\\\n\nCl\u00e9ment \u00e9clata de rire au jeu de mots, tandis que Zo\u00e9 se pr\u00e9senta, elle et son fr\u00e8re.\\\\\n\n-- Pour vous remercier d'avoir partag\u00e9 votre repas avec moi, que diriez-vous si je vous conduisais \u00e0 votre troupeau ?\\\\\n\n-- On a un troupeau ? chuchota Cl\u00e9ment.\\\\\n\n-- Il parle de nos camarades et de Mademoiselle Ludivine, l'informa Zo\u00e9.\\\\\n\n-- Alors, qu'en dites-vous ?\\\\\n\n-- Oui ! Oui... on vous en serait tr\u00e8s reconnaissants, Monsieur DuBois ! dit Zo\u00e9 avec un sourire.\\\\\n\n-- Appelez-moi F\u00e9lix. Monsieur DuBois est mon p\u00e8re, dit-il avant de leur demander de le suivre.\\\\\n\nIls march\u00e8rent un moment en silence, puis Cl\u00e9ment commen\u00e7a \u00e0 interroger leur guide.\\\\\n\n-- Et vous \u00eates s\u00fbr que vous n'avez pas de pouvoirs magiques ? demanda-t-il.\\\\\n\n-- S\u00fbr et certain, mon petit, r\u00e9pondit l'\u00e9cureuil patiemment.\\\\\n\n-- Et les autres habitants du bois ? Est-ce qu'ils en ont ?\\\\\n\n-- Hmm... eh bien, oui. Certains, comme les vieux ch\u00eanes, les loups, ou l'aigle.\\\\\n\nCl\u00e9ment \u00e9coutait avec des yeux brillants d'\u00e9merveillement. F\u00e9lix continua :\\\\\n\n-- Le vieux ch\u00eane a le pouvoir de gu\u00e9rison. Les animaux bless\u00e9s viennent souvent \u00e0 lui pour demander de l'aide. Il est aussi le plus vieux de la for\u00eat, apr\u00e8s tout.\\\\\n\nIls march\u00e8rent encore un peu avant d'atteindre la cascade sacr\u00e9e, l'endroit o\u00f9 les animaux se d\u00e9salt\u00e8rent. Ils y virent toutes sortes d'animaux. Cl\u00e9ment, impressionn\u00e9, serra la main de sa s\u0153ur.\\\\\n\n-- C'est bizarre, je ne le vois pas. Il devrait \u00eatre ici, dit F\u00e9lix. Octave, notre aigle, vient toujours \u00e0 cette heure...\\\\\n\nUne louve au pelage blanc salua F\u00e9lix.\\\\\n\n-- Bonjour, F\u00e9lix. Toujours aussi radieuse, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne, r\u00e9pondit F\u00e9lix. Aurais-tu vu Octave ?\\\\\n\n-- Il est malade. Tu le trouveras s\u00fbrement pr\u00e8s du vieux ch\u00eane, dit-elle.\\\\\n\nF\u00e9lix guida les enfants vers le ch\u00eane.\\\\\n\n-- Bonjour, Aristide. Nous cherchons Octave, nous a-t-on dit qu'il est chez toi.\\\\\n\n-- Bonjour, F\u00e9lix et petits humains, r\u00e9pondit une voix masculine. Octave n'est pas en forme, mais je peux vous aider.\\\\\n\nApr\u00e8s une explication, Aristide offrit de soulever F\u00e9lix pour lui permettre de rep\u00e9rer leur groupe. Un instant plus tard, F\u00e9lix annon\u00e7a :\\\\\n\n-- Ils sont par-l\u00e0 ! Et pas tr\u00e8s loin, heureusement.\\\\\n\nLes enfants remerci\u00e8rent le ch\u00eane et reprirent leur chemin.\\\\\n\n-- Pourquoi n'as-tu pas grimp\u00e9 sur le ch\u00eane ? demanda Cl\u00e9ment.\\\\\n\n-- Parce que cela aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 offensant pour Aristide ! cria F\u00e9lix. Non, mais grimper le vieux ch\u00eane... quel scandale...\\\\\n\n-- Je vous prie de l'excuser, il n'est pas instruit sur votre culture, dit Zo\u00e9.\\\\\n\n-- Peu importe, peu importe... r\u00e9pondit F\u00e9lix.\\\\\n\nApr\u00e8s une bonne demi-heure, F\u00e9lix d\u00e9clara qu'ils \u00e9taient arriv\u00e9s.\\\\\n\n-- Marchez tout droit, tournez \u00e0 droite au grand sapin et vous verrez votre troupeau. Mais promettez de garder le silence sur tout ce que vous avez vu.\\\\\n\nZo\u00e9 et Cl\u00e9ment firent la promesse, remerci\u00e8rent F\u00e9lix, et repartirent. Une fois arriv\u00e9s au camp, Mademoiselle Ludivine les accueillit avec soulagement.\\\\\n\n-- Comment avez-vous retrouv\u00e9 votre chemin ? demanda-t-elle.\\\\\n\n-- Euh, on a juste march\u00e9 et on s'est retrouv\u00e9s ici par chance, dit Zo\u00e9 en clignant de l'\u0153il \u00e0 son fr\u00e8re.\\\\\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item Pourquoi Cl\u00e9ment est tomb\u00e9 ?\n    \\begin{enumerate}\n        \\item[A.] Parce qu'il ne faisait pas attention o\u00f9 il allait\n        \\item[B.] Car il y avait une branche par terre\n        \\item[C.] Car Zo\u00e9 lui avait fait un accroche-pied\n        \\item[D.] Parce que ses lacets \u00e9taient d\u00e9faits\n    \\end{enumerate}\n\n    \\item Qu'avait sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 Cl\u00e9ment \u00e0 Zo\u00e9 pour retrouver leur chemin ?\n    \\begin{enumerate}\n        \\item[A.] Grimper sur un arbre\n        \\item[B.] Crier \u00e0 l'aide\n        \\item[C.] Appeler les secours au t\u00e9l\u00e9phone\n        \\item[D.] Allumer un feu\n    \\end{enumerate}\n\n    \\item Qu'avaient donn\u00e9 les enfants \u00e0 l'\u00e9cureuil ?\n    \\begin{enumerate}\n        \\item[A.] Des bonbons\n        \\item[B.] De la laitue\n        \\item[C.] De la tarte aux noix de p\u00e9cans\n        \\item[D.] Des noisettes\n    \\end{enumerate}\n\n    \\item Quel est le nom de la louve qui avait parl\u00e9 \u00e0 F\u00e9lix ?\n    \\begin{enumerate}\n        \\item[A.] Sol\u00e8ne\n        \\item[B.] Ir\u00e8ne\n        \\item[C.] Madeleine\n        \\item[D.] H\u00e9l\u00e8ne\n    \\end{enumerate}\n\n    \\item Qui avait aid\u00e9 F\u00e9lix et les enfants pour retrouver leur chemin ?\n    \\begin{enumerate}\n        \\item[A.] Les loups\n        \\item[B.] L'aigle\n        \\item[C.] La gazelle\n        \\item[D.] Le vieux ch\u00eane\n    \\end{enumerate}\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\\subsection*{Answers}\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item D\n    \\item A\n    \\item C\n    \\item D\n    \\item D\n\\end{enumerate}"

Il d\u00e9cida de profiter du beau temps et de passer le reste de la journ\u00e9e dehors.\\\\\n\nIl alla alors chercher Maman et la trouva dans le salon, en train de passer l'aspirateur.\\\\\nIl se tint droit et attendit qu'elle d\u00e9branche l'engin pour passer \u00e0 un autre coin de la pi\u00e8ce, puis, il l'appela.\\\\\n\n-- Maman ?\\\\\n\n-- Oui, mon ch\u00e9ri ? r\u00e9pondit-elle avec un sourire.\\\\\n\nC'\u00e9tait un bon signe ; il y avait peu de chances de refus si elle \u00e9tait de bonne humeur.\\\\\n\n-- J'ai fini de ranger ma chambre, et je me disais qu'il serait bien si on allait faire un pique-nique maintenant\u2026 dit Alexandre avec un regard suppliant.\\\\\n\nMaman lui sourit tristement avant de lui dire qu'elle \u00e9tait trop occup\u00e9e pour le moment et qu'il lui restait encore plein de corv\u00e9es.\\\\\n\n-- S'il te pla\u00eet ! Il fait si beau dehors !\\\\\n\n-- Mais je ne peux pas laisser tout ce travail fait \u00e0 moiti\u00e9, mon chou. Tu sais que je peux seulement nettoyer la maison pendant le week-end \u00e0 cause de mon travail, expliqua-t-elle.\\\\\n\n-- D'accord, je peux t'attendre. Quand est-ce que tu vas finir de faire le m\u00e9nage ?\\\\\n\nMaman soupira avant de c\u00e9der.\\\\\n\n-- Peut-\u00eatre dans une heure\u2026 ou moins, si je fais plus vite. Tu peux aller chercher la couverture de pique-nique et l'installer dans le jardin pendant que je termine. Tu la trouveras dans le placard.\\\\\n\nAlexandre remercia sa Maman et courut faire ce qu'elle lui avait demand\u00e9.\\\\\nIl lutta un peu contre la couverture, qui \u00e9tait coinc\u00e9e sous les draps, avant de la tirer du placard et alla au jardin pour choisir l'endroit parfait o\u00f9 la mettre.\\\\\nD'abord, il pensa \u00e0 la mettre pr\u00e8s des fleurs, mais changea d'avis en voyant les abeilles butiner.\\\\\nEnsuite, il essaya de poser la couverture au centre du jardin, sur l'herbe fra\u00eechement tondue, mais le soleil tapait trop fort.\\\\\nFinalement, il installa la couverture sous l'ombre d'un arbre, l'endroit parfait.\\\\\n\nUne fois sa t\u00e2che accomplie, Alexandre regarda la couverture et pensa que la couleur verte des carr\u00e9s qui la composaient ressemblait \u00e0 celle de l'herbe.\\\\\nAlors qu'il remarquait ce d\u00e9tail, il aper\u00e7ut du coin de l'\u0153il quelques fourmis grimper sur la couverture.\\\\\nIl les chassa, puis s'allongea sur la couverture pour admirer le ciel en attendant que sa m\u00e8re le rejoigne.\\\\\nBerc\u00e9 par les nuages et la douce chaleur du printemps, Alexandre s'endormit. Une petite sieste lui ferait du bien avant le repas de midi.\\\\\n\nAlexandre ne sut pas combien de temps s'\u00e9tait \u00e9coul\u00e9 avant qu'il ne se r\u00e9veille, d\u00e9sorient\u00e9. Cependant, en regardant autour de lui, il se trouva dans une chambre qu'il ne reconnaissait pas.\\\\\nC'\u00e9tait une grande pi\u00e8ce avec du papier peint ressemblant \u00e0 celui de chez sa grand-m\u00e8re, un barreau en bois et une chemin\u00e9e.\\\\\nIl jeta les draps qu'il ne reconnaissait pas par-dessus lui et tenta de quitter le lit, mais \u00e9choua et fit une chute.\\\\\n\nMais qu'est-ce qu'il faisait dans ce lit de g\u00e9ant ?!\\\\\n\nIl se leva du sol et se dirigea vers le grand balcon. Ce qu'il vit le surprit au point de lui couper le souffle.\\\\\nLa vue \u00e9tait sublime : une grande plaine form\u00e9e de carr\u00e9s alternant de couleur, tant\u00f4t un vert d'herbe, tant\u00f4t un blanc de marguerite.\\\\\nUn peu plus loin, il vit un village avec plein de petites maisons et de chalets.\\\\\n\nLorsqu'il avan\u00e7a davantage sur le balcon, il aper\u00e7ut un jardin avec un labyrinthe d'un c\u00f4t\u00e9, des rosiers de l'autre et une fontaine au centre.\\\\\nCurieux, il se pencha sur les rails du balcon et leva la t\u00eate pour voir l'endroit offrant une si belle vue. Il s'agissait d'un ch\u00e2teau.\\\\\n\nAlexandre n'y comprenait rien. Il d\u00e9cida de retourner \u00e0 l'int\u00e9rieur et de s'habiller pour d\u00e9couvrir o\u00f9 il se trouvait.\\\\\nIl avait \u00e0 peine fait un pas lorsqu'un homme entra dans la chambre avec un \u201cBonjour, messire !\u201d\\\\\n\nAlexandre le regarda avec h\u00e9sitation. Il voulait lui demander qui il \u00e9tait, mais les mots le trahirent, et il le scruta en silence.\\\\\n\n-- Je vois que quelqu'un s'est lev\u00e9 du mauvais pied aujourd'hui\u2026 murmura l'homme, qui se tourna ensuite vers l'armoire pour fouiller dedans.\\\\\n\n-- Que faites-vous ? dit Alexandre, retrouvant enfin sa voix.\\\\\n\n-- Hmm ? Le monsieur se tourna vers lui, pencha la t\u00eate et fron\u00e7a les sourcils. Ce que je fais chaque matin, \u00e9videmment.

Il regardait l'\u00e9mission avec elle d\u00e8s le d\u00e9but et parut aussi impressionn\u00e9 qu'elle l'\u00e9tait, avec les yeux grands ouverts et de petits souffles \u00e0 chaque fois qu'un mouvement \u00e9tait d\u00e9montr\u00e9. \\\\\n\\textit{-Oui !} agr\u00e9e Beth avec enthousiasme avant que les deux ne se turent de nouveau pour se concentrer sur l'\u00e9mission. \\\\\nLes deux rest\u00e8rent ainsi jusqu'\u00e0 la fin de l'\u00e9mission et ne se lev\u00e8rent que lorsqu'ils furent appel\u00e9s pour descendre prendre leur d\u00e9jeuner. \\\\\n\\textit{-Je veux devenir une artiste martiale quand je serai grande !} la petite fille dit en sautant les marches de l'escalier. \\\\\n\\textit{-Pas moi !} dit son cousin en courant derri\u00e8re elle avec maladresse. \\\\\nSes mots la firent froncer les yeux en confusion. N'\u00e9tait-il pas aussi impressionn\u00e9 qu'elle, tout \u00e0 l'heure ? Comment pouvait-il dire \u00e7a ? \\\\\n\\textit{-Pourquoi pas ?} demanda-t-elle sur un ton qui refl\u00e9tait autant de surprise qu'elle avait ressentie. \\\\\n\\textit{-J'ai entendu dire que les artistes martiaux doivent s'entra\u00eener tr\u00e8s dur. J'ai aussi entendu dire qu'ils doivent casser leurs os et se d\u00e9chirer les muscles pour devenir aussi forts qu'ils le sont,} r\u00e9pondit-il. \\\\\n\\textit{-Tu n'es pas s\u00e9rieux !} exclama-t-elle. C'\u00e9tait horrible ! Qui peut bien subir une telle torture ? Beth fr\u00e9mit en pensant au fait de subir cette douleur pour devenir un bon artiste martial et elle pensa qu'elle devrait peut-\u00eatre y repenser. \\\\\n\nMais elle continua \u00e0 penser \u00e0 l'\u00e9mission qu'elle avait regard\u00e9e tout \u00e0 l'heure et \u00e0 quel point la dame \u00e9tait cool quand elle donnait des coups de poing et des coups de pied aux planches en bois. \\\\\nElle voulait vraiment \u00eatre comme elle. Peut-\u00eatre qu'elle pourrait prendre des m\u00e9dicaments qui l'aideraient \u00e0 supporter la douleur quand elle commencerait \u00e0 s'entra\u00eener ? \\\\\nElle regarda son cousin et plissa les yeux. Peut-\u00eatre que Bobby avait tort \u00e0 propos de ce qu'il lui avait dit tout \u00e0 l'heure... Et puis, d'o\u00f9 il savait, lui ? \\\\\nElle devait poser la question \u00e0 quelqu'un de confiance et elle savait exactement \u00e0 qui s'adresser ! \\\\\n\nPlus tard dans la journ\u00e9e, quand son cousin fit sa sieste, elle descendit parler \u00e0 son grand fr\u00e8re qui \u00e9tait charg\u00e9 de rester avec eux pendant que leurs parents \u00e9taient absents pour la journ\u00e9e. \\\\\n\\textit{-Coucou, Keith !} elle le salua avec bonne humeur. Son grand fr\u00e8re \u00e9tait la personne la plus intelligente qu'elle connaissait. Plus intelligent que ses parents, m\u00eame ! \\\\\nIl r\u00e9pondait toujours \u00e0 ses questions et m\u00eame quand il ne connaissait pas la r\u00e9ponse, il la cherchait pour elle. \\\\\n\\textit{-Coucou, s\u0153urette !} r\u00e9pondit-il avec un sourire en fermant le livre qu'il \u00e9tait en train de lire. \\\\\n\\textit{-Que puis-je faire pour toi ?} dit-il en lui pin\u00e7ant le nez avec un sourire taquin. \\\\\nBeth rigola et s'assit \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 de lui sur le canap\u00e9. \\\\\n\\textit{-J'ai une question pour toi.} Elle commen\u00e7a. Quand son fr\u00e8re hocha la t\u00eate, elle continua. \\\\\n\\textit{-Est-ce qu'il est vrai que les artistes martiaux doivent se briser les os et se d\u00e9chirer les muscles quand ils s'entra\u00eenent pour devenir plus forts ?} \\\\\n\nLes yeux de son grand fr\u00e8re devinrent plus larges et il prit un moment avant de lui r\u00e9pondre. \\\\\n\\textit{-Je suis s\u00fbr que ce n'est pas le cas. Qui te l'a dit ?} \\\\\n\\textit{-Bobby.} \\\\\n\\textit{-Eh bien, comme je te l'ai dit, je ne crois pas que c'est vrai, mais regardons sur internet juste pour \u00eatre certains.} \\\\\n\nBeth regarda Keith sortir son t\u00e9l\u00e9phone de sa poche et taper dessus avant de lire ce qui \u00e9tait \u00e9crit sur l'\u00e9cran pendant quelques instants. \\\\\n\\textit{-Bon, c'est un peu correct, en quelque sorte.} Beth laissa \u00e9chapper un souffle d'horreur, le poussant \u00e0 lever une main pour la calmer. \\\\\n\\textit{-Mais, ce n'est pas aussi douloureux que ce qu'on croit.} \\\\\n\nBeth parut un peu soulag\u00e9e par ces mots. \\\\\n\\textit{-Eh bien, c'est comment alors ?} demanda-t-elle avec curiosit\u00e9. \\\\\nSi ce n'\u00e9tait pas de la torture comme elle le croyait, alors elle avait encore une chance pour devenir une artiste martiale dans le futur. \\\\\nElle \u00e9tait une fille costaud et elle pourrait supporter un peu de douleur ! L'autre jour, elle \u00e9tait tomb\u00e9e et s'\u00e9tait bless\u00e9e au genou, mais elle n'avait m\u00eame pas pleur\u00e9 ! \\\\\n\nKeith sourit et lui \u00e9bouriffa les cheveux. Il tint son t\u00e9l\u00e9phone en face d'elle et pointa l'\u00e9cran du doigt. \\\\\n\\textit{-D'apr\u00e8s cet article, quand les gens s'entra\u00eenent pour un sport qui n\u00e9cessite de frapper quelque chose ou quelqu'un, ils doivent donner des coups avec leurs mains, pieds, genoux et tout.} Il expliqua. \\\\\n\\textit{Et des fois, ils cassent des planches en bois et des trucs du genre. Pour faire \u00e7a, ils doivent frapper \u00e0 grande vitesse ou bien ils doivent \u00eatre tr\u00e8s forts. Id\u00e9alement, l'artiste martial utilise une combinaison de force et de vitesse.} \\\\\n\n\\textit{Pour devenir aussi forts, ils doivent s'entra\u00eener en soulevant des poids et en faisant des exercices comme des pompes et en frappant des sacs de boxe, et c'est ce qui cause les fissures dans leurs os et leurs muscles.} \\\\\n\\textit{Mais ces fissures ne sont pas dangereuses.} l'assura-t-il avec un sourire. \\\\\n\\textit{Ce sont juste de toutes petites fissures dans leurs os et quand elles gu\u00e9rissent, l'os devient plus dur et plus fort dans ces endroits.} conclut-il. \\\\\n\n\\textit{-Ohh... ! C'est logique,} Beth dit en hochant lentement la t\u00eate. \\\\\n\\textit{-C'est la m\u00eame chose pour les muscles, et \u00e7a n'arrive pas qu'aux artistes martiaux. Des gens comme ceux qui font du bodybuilding soul\u00e8vent des poids lourds et \u00e7a cause des petites fissures dans leurs muscles \u00e0 cause de la charge. Quand le muscle gu\u00e9rit et se reconstruit, il devient plus grand et plus fort. C'est pour \u00e7a que certains artistes martiaux peuvent briser des briques avec leurs mains, parce qu'ils sont assez forts mais aussi parce qu'ils sont assez rapides quand ils les frappent.} \\\\\n\n\\textit{-Alors, \u00e7a ne fait pas mal du tout ?} la petite fille demanda. Elle voulait s'assurer avant de prendre sa d\u00e9cision. \\\\\n\\textit{-Eh bien, je suis s\u00fbr que ce genre d'entra\u00eenement peut leur donner des courbatures et leur faire un peu mal, mais ce n'est rien de dangereux et s'ils le font correctement, ils ne risquent pas de se blesser,} r\u00e9pondit-il. \\\\\n\\textit{Le myst\u00e8re est r\u00e9solu ! Es-tu satisfaite, jeune demoiselle ?} \\\\\n\nBeth sourit et hocha la t\u00eate. \\\\\n\\textit{-Oui !

Contente de recevoir une visite de son grand-p\u00e8re, elle s'\u00e9tait r\u00e9veill\u00e9e de bonne humeur ce matin.\\\\\nGrand-p\u00e8re \u00e9tait le membre de la famille qu'elle pr\u00e9f\u00e9rait, son meilleur ami parmi les adultes, et elle adorait passer du temps avec lui.\\\\\nHier soir, lorsqu'il lui avait annonc\u00e9 sa visite imminente au t\u00e9l\u00e9phone, il lui avait promis un cadeau et elle \u00e9tait surexcit\u00e9e.\\\\\nD'ailleurs, elle avait eu des difficult\u00e9s \u00e0 se coucher tellement elle \u00e9tait \u00e9moustill\u00e9e.\\\\\n\nGrand-p\u00e8re arriva \u00e0 10h du matin. Il embrassa Maman et Papa avant de prendre Margot dans ses bras.\\\\\n\n-- Et comment va ma petite fille pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9e ? demanda-t-il, ses yeux chaleureux regardant Margot avec tendresse.\\\\\n\nMargot rigola et r\u00e9pondit avec humour :\\\\\n\n-- Je suis ta seule petite fille, grand-p\u00e8re ! Et je vais tr\u00e8s bien, merci !\\\\\n\nPuis elle ajouta :\\\\\n\n-- Et comment va mon grand-p\u00e8re pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 ?\\\\\n\nGrand-p\u00e8re, surpris par l'espi\u00e8glerie de Margot, laissa \u00e9chapper un rire avant de lui assurer que, lui aussi, allait tr\u00e8s bien.\\\\\n\n-- Mais je sais qu'il y a quelque chose que tu veux avoir plus que mes nouvelles, hein ? dit grand-p\u00e8re avec un air taquin.\\\\\n\nMargot ne sut comment r\u00e9pondre, elle se tortilla un peu avant de le regarder avec ses grands yeux innocents, mais grand-p\u00e8re n'\u00e9tait pas dupe.\\\\\nIl la posa par terre et ils se dirig\u00e8rent tous deux vers le canap\u00e9.\\\\\n\nAssis l'un \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 de l'autre, Margot regardait grand-p\u00e8re plonger sa main dans un sac en papier avant d'en sortir un petit pot en argile contenant une plante \u00e9pineuse.\\\\\nMargot pencha la t\u00eate par curiosit\u00e9 et scruta la plante que son grand-p\u00e8re avait pos\u00e9e sur la petite table en face d'eux.\\\\\n\n-- C'est ta surprise, ma ch\u00e9rie. J'esp\u00e8re qu'elle te pla\u00eet, lui dit-il.\\\\\n\n-- C'est quoi ? r\u00e9pondit-elle, tout en se mettant \u00e0 genoux devant la table pour observer la plante de plus pr\u00e8s.\\\\\n\n-- Eh bien, c'est une plante. Un cactus, pour \u00eatre plus pr\u00e9cis, r\u00e9pondit grand-p\u00e8re avec amusement.\\\\\n\nMargot hocha la t\u00eate avec grand int\u00e9r\u00eat. Un moment plus tard, elle \u00e9tendit sa main pour toucher la plante ronde mais son \u00e9lan fut interrompu par grand-p\u00e8re, qui lui attrapa la main avant qu'elle ne puisse la toucher.\\\\\n\n-- Attention \u00e0 ne pas te faire piquer, dit-il, en indiquant les petites \u00e9pines qui recouvraient la surface du cactus.\\\\\n\n-- Qu'est-ce que je suis cens\u00e9e faire avec ? demanda Margot, toujours sans quitter des yeux la plante qui la fascinait.\\\\\n\n-- T'en occuper et la faire pousser. Est-ce que \u00e7a te tente ?\\\\\n\n-- Oui, je veux bien essayer !\\\\\n\nUne fois grand-p\u00e8re rentr\u00e9 chez lui, Margot emmena la plante dans sa chambre.\\\\\nElle l'installa devant sa fen\u00eatre et l'admira dans son nouvel entourage.\\\\\nSe rappelant que son grand-p\u00e8re lui avait dit qu'elle devait s'en occuper et, sachant que Papa arrosait toujours les plantes du balcon, Margot d\u00e9cida de faire la m\u00eame chose.\\\\\nElle alla chercher un verre d'eau et le versa dans le pot, autour de la plante.\\\\\n\n-- Je vais te donner \u00e0 boire tous les jours ! dit-elle au petit cactus.\\\\\n\nSatisfaite, elle alla faire sa toilette avant d'aller au lit.\\\\\n\nPendant les jours qui suivirent, Margot arrosait son cactus r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement. Elle s'assurait qu'il e\u00fbt assez de soleil et a\u00e9ra sa chambre tous les matins.\\\\\nElle demandait aussi \u00e0 son p\u00e8re d'enlever les petits insectes et parasites qui se posaient sur sa petite plante ador\u00e9e qu'elle cultivait avec amour.\\\\\n\nCependant, malgr\u00e9 ses efforts, son petit cactus commen\u00e7a \u00e0 perdre son \u00e9clat.\\\\\nSa belle couleur verte devint p\u00e2le et Margot sut qu'il se portait mal.\\\\\nElle se rappela de ce qui \u00e9tait arriv\u00e9 aux plantes que son p\u00e8re avait n\u00e9glig\u00e9es lorsqu'ils \u00e9taient partis en vacances l'an dernier.\\\\\n\nRefusant de laisser son cactus mourir, Margot redoubla d'efforts.\\\\\nElle commen\u00e7a \u00e0 l'arroser deux fois par jour et l'emmena au balcon pour lui garantir plus de soleil et d'air frais.\\\\\nMais, malheureusement, cela ne changea rien et l'\u00e9tat de sa plante s'empira.\\\\\n\nD\u00e9sesp\u00e9r\u00e9e, Margot passa un coup de fil \u00e0 Grand-p\u00e8re pour lui dire ce qui se passait.\\\\\n\n-- Mon cactus est en train de mourir, pourtant j'en ai pris bien soin ! cria-t-elle, les larmes aux yeux.\\\\\n\nSon grand-p\u00e8re lui demanda de lui expliquer comment elle s'en occupait, esp\u00e9rant identifier ce qui avait bien pu contrarier la petite plante.\\\\\nMargot prit le temps de lui raconter sa routine et, une fois qu'elle eut fini, grand-p\u00e8re lui dit :\\\\\n\n-- Je suis d\u00e9sol\u00e9, ma puce. Je t'ai donn\u00e9 le cactus mais j'ai n\u00e9glig\u00e9 de t'expliquer comment t'en occuper.\\\\\nVois-tu, un cactus est diff\u00e9rent des autres plantes. Il ne demande pas beaucoup d'eau.\\\\\nEn fait, tu as seulement besoin de l'arroser une fois par semaine. En l'arrosant chaque jour, c'est comme si tu le noyais et les racines deviennent pourries en cons\u00e9quence.\\\\\n\n-- Et donc, qu'est-ce que je dois faire maintenant ? demanda-t-elle.\\\\\n\n-- Ne fais rien. Je viens te voir demain. On va enlever la partie pourrie, s'il y en a, et on va rempoter ton cactus dans du terreau sec.\\\\\nAllez, s\u00e8che tes larmes, ma petite, tout va bien se passer.\\\\\n\nMargot, rassur\u00e9e par les mots de son grand-p\u00e8re, cessa de pleurer. Elle le remercia avant de raccrocher et r\u00e9p\u00e9ta les mots de son grand-p\u00e8re \u00e0 la petite plante :\\\\\n\n-- Tout ira bien, on va te sauver.\\\\\n\nLe lendemain, grand-p\u00e8re tint sa parole et arriva chez Margot le matin.\\\\\nIl avait apport\u00e9 un pot neuf et un sac de terreau sp\u00e9cial cactus. Margot le regarda avec attention.\\\\\nElle le vit retirer la plante de son pot actuel, enlever le terreau boueux des racines avant d'en couper une grande partie.\\\\\nEnsuite, il mit des cailloux dans le fond du nouveau pot avant d'y verser du terreau.\\\\\nIl posa le cactus au centre avant de se tapoter les mains pour se d\u00e9barrasser du terreau qui y \u00e9tait rest\u00e9.\\\\\n\n-- Voil\u00e0, cela devrait faire l'affaire, dit grand-p\u00e8re.\\\\\n\nAvant de partir, il donna quelques astuces \u00e0 Margot.\\\\\nIl lui dit de ne pas arroser la plante pendant trois semaines et lui sugg\u00e9ra de la faire tourner un peu chaque jour pour faire en sorte que toutes ses parties re\u00e7oivent leur part de soleil.\\\\\n\nUn mois plus tard, Margot, assise en face de sa fen\u00eatre, chuchota \u00e0 la petite plante qui avait retrouv\u00e9 son \u00e9clat :\\\\\n\n-- Tu vois, je t'ai bien dit qu'on allait te sauver !\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item Grand-p\u00e8re avait promis \u00e0 Margot... ?\n    \\begin{enumerate}\n        \\item[A.] Un chaton\n        \\item[B.] Un cadeau\n        \\item[C.] Un g\u00e2teau\n        \\item[D.] Un bracelet\n    \\end{enumerate}\n\n    \\item Quel cadeau avait ramener Grand p\u00e8re \u00e0 Margot ?\n    \\begin{enumerate}\n        \\item[A.] Une plante de verveine\n        \\item[B.] Une plante de menthe poivr\u00e9e\n        \\item[C.] Un rosier\n        \\item[D.] Un cactus\n    \\end{enumerate}\n\n    \\item Qu'avait fait Margot pour prendre soin de sa plante ?\n    \\begin{enumerate}\n        \\item[A.] Elle lui donnait des vitamines\n        \\item[B.] Elle l'arrosait r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement\n        \\item[C.] Elle lui appliquait des lotions\n        \\item[D.] Rien du tout\n    \\end{enumerate}\n\n    \\item Qu'est-il arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 la plante apr\u00e8s quelques jours ?\n    \\begin{enumerate}\n        \\item[A.] Elle perdit sa couleur\n        \\item[B.] Elle commen\u00e7a \u00e0 pousser\n        \\item[C.] Elle perdit ses feuilles\n        \\item[D.] Elle perdit ses \u00e9pines\n    \\end{enumerate}\n\n    \\item Pour sauver la plante, Grand p\u00e8re l'avait... ?\n    \\begin{enumerate}\n        \\item[A.] Rempoter\n        \\item[B.] Arros\u00e9\n        \\item[C.] Lav\u00e9\n        \\item[D.] Sortit au balcon\n    \\end{enumerate}\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\\subsection*{Answers}\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item B\n    \\item D\n    \\item B\n    \\item A\n    \\item A\n\\end{enumerate}"
