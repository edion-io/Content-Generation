Dieser Mann war sehr arm, aber er besaß ein Pferd, das so exquisit war, das selbst Könige es ihm abkaufen wollten-  und das zu jedem Preis. Doch der Mann lehnte immer wieder ab. Plötzlich eines Morgens, stellte er fest, dass das Pferd verschwunden war. Alle Menschen aus dem Dorf versammelten um ihr Mitgefühl auszudrücken.\\

Sie sagten: ""Oh, was für ein Unglück, was hättest du für ein Vermögen mit diesem Pferd verdienen können und man hat dir so viel dafür geboten! Aber du warst zu dickköpfig und zu dumm. Jetzt ist das Pferd weg. ""\\

Aber der alte Mann lachte nur und sagte: ""Ach redet doch keinen Unsinn: ""Alles was man darüber sagen kann, ist, dass das Pferd jetzt nicht mehr in seinem Stall ist. Lass die Zukunft kommen und uns zeigen was passiert""\\

Nach wenigen Tagen kehrte das Pferd plötzlich zurück in seinen Stall. Nicht nur das, es brachte eine ganze Herde wilder Pferde aus dem Wald mit. Und wieder versammelte sich das ganze Dorf und sie sagten: ""Unglaublich, der alte Mann hatte Recht sein Pferd ist tatsächlich zurückgekommen, und es hat auch noch ein ganzes dutzend toller Pferde mitgebracht. Jetzt kann er so viel Geld verdienen, wie er will."" Und sie gingen zu dem alten Mann und sagten: ""Oh es tut uns Leid wir konnten das ja nicht voraussehen und die Wege Gottes verstehen, aber du bist unglaublich. Du hast es wohl irgendwie geahnt. Vielleicht kannst du sogar die Zukunft voraussehen.""\\

""So ein Quatsch."" sagte der alte Mann nur. ""Ich weiß nur, eins: Nämlich, dass das Pferd mit einer ganzen Herde Pferde zurückgekommen ist und was morgen geschehen wird, das weiß nur der liebe Gott.""\\

Und schon ein paar Tage später geschah es, das der einzige Sohn des Mannes, der die neuen Pferde zureiten wollte, dabei vom Pferd fiel. Er brach sich dabei seine Beine so schwer, das er fortan wohl nicht mehr würde richtig laufen können. Die Menschen kamen wieder zu dem alten Mann und sagten: ""Du hast recht gehabt. Man weiß nie. Die Sache mit den Pferden hat sich als ein Fluch erwiesen. Da wäre es besser gewesen, wären die Pferde überhaupt gar nicht erst gekommen. Nun wird dein Sohn für sein ganzes Leben lang verkrüppelt sein.\\

Aber der alte Mann sagte wieder nur: ""Nicht so voreilig. Wartet ab! Man wird sehen was geschieht. Man kann nämlich nur eines darüber sagen, nämlich, dass mein Sohn sich die Beine gebrochen hat. Das ist alles.""\\

Einige Wochen später ergab es sich das in dem Land ein Krieg ausbrach und alle die jungen Männer des Dorfes von der Regierung zwangsweise eingezogen wurden. Nur der Sohn des alten Mannes durfte zu Hause bleiben, weil er für den Krieg untauglich war.\\

Und wieder versammelten sich alle Menschen des Dorfes und klagten: ""Unsere Söhne sind fort und du hast wenigstens noch deinen Sohn. Er mag zwar seine Beine gebrochen haben, aber er ist bei dir. Unsere Söhne sind fort und der Feind ist vielleicht viel mächtiger. Wahrscheinlich werden sie alle sterben. Jetzt werden wir niemanden haben, der sich im Alter um uns kümmert. Aber du hast ja noch deinen Sohn. Er wird bestimmt wieder gesund.\\

Doch der alte Mann sagte wieder nur: ""Man kann darüber nur eins sagen: Eure Söhne wurden eingezogen. Mein Sohn ist hier geblieben. Daraus folgt jedoch gar nichts.\\

\begin{enumerate}
\item Wie viele Pferde hatte der Mann am Anfang?
\item Mit wem lebte der Mann?
\item Wer kam immer zu dem Mann, um seine Situation zu beurteilen?

\subsection*{Translation}
Once upon a time, there was a poor man who lived in a village. This man was very poor, but he owned a horse so exquisite that even kings wanted to buy it from him—at any price. Yet, the man repeatedly refused. One morning, he suddenly discovered that the horse was gone. All the villagers gathered to express their sympathy.\\

They said: “Oh, what bad luck! You could have earned a fortune with that horse, and so many had offered you so much for it! But you were too stubborn and too foolish. Now the horse is gone.”\\

But the old man just laughed and said: “Oh, stop talking nonsense. All that can be said about this is that the horse is no longer in its stable. Let the future come and show us what will happen.”\\

A few days later, the horse suddenly returned to its stable. Not only that, but it brought with it an entire herd of wild horses from the forest. Once again, the whole village gathered, and they said: “Unbelievable! The old man was right—his horse actually came back, and it even brought a dozen fine horses with it. Now he can earn as much money as he wants.” They went to the old man and said: “Oh, we are sorry; we could not foresee this or understand God’s ways. But you are incredible. You must have had some inkling. Maybe you can even see the future.”\\

“Nonsense,” said the old man. “I only know one thing: the horse came back with a whole herd of horses. What will happen tomorrow is known only to God.”\\

And just a few days later, it happened that the man’s only son, who was trying to tame the new horses, fell off one of them. He broke his legs so badly that he would likely never be able to walk properly again. The people came to the old man once more and said: “You were right. One never knows. This business with the horses turned out to be a curse. It would have been better if the horses had never come at all. Now your son will be crippled for the rest of his life.”\\

But the old man again said: “Don’t be so quick to judge. Wait and see! All that can be said is that my son broke his legs. That’s all.”\\

A few weeks later, a war broke out in the land, and all the young men of the village were forcibly conscripted by the government. Only the old man’s son was allowed to stay home because he was unfit for war.\\

Once again, all the villagers gathered and lamented: “Our sons are gone, but at least you still have your son. He may have broken his legs, but he is here with you. Our sons are gone, and the enemy may be far more powerful. They will probably all die. Now we will have no one to care for us in our old age. But you still have your son. He will surely recover.”\\

But the old man once again said: “There is only one thing that can be said: your sons were conscripted. My son stayed here. That’s all. Nothing follows from this.”\\

Give me a reading comprehension exercise for a student learning French. It should have a subsection for answers.,"Magali sourit avec satisfaction en regardant les deux pages pleines de son cahier. Finir ses devoirs lui inspirait toujours un sentiment de productivité. Elle commença à ranger ses affaires lorsqu'elle entendit frapper à sa porte. Elle vit qu'il s'agissait de sa mère, qui entra après avoir reçu sa permission.\\

-- Salut, ma chérie. Que fais-tu ? dit Maman avec un tendre sourire.\\

-- Salut ! répondit la fillette en haussant les épaules. Rien du tout. Je viens de finir mes devoirs, et maintenant je n'ai plus rien à faire.\\

-- C'est très bien, ma puce, la louangea Maman. Et ça tombe bien que tu n'aies plus rien à faire, parce que j'ai quelque chose pour toi.\\

Magali s'assit sur sa chaise de bureau, attendant que Maman lui révèle ce qu'elle lui avait apporté. Celle-ci sortit un livre caché derrière son dos et le lui tendit.\\

-- C'est un livre de coloriage et un conte de fées en même temps, dit Maman avant de s'installer à côté de Magali, qui ouvrait le livre.\\

-- Tu vois, là. Elle lui montra une image du doigt. C'est l'illustration de référence. Tu dois colorier le dessin avec les mêmes couleurs que celles qui y sont. Et dans cette partie, dit-elle en lui montrant l'autre page, se trouve l'histoire.\\

Après son explication et après que sa fille l'eut remerciée, Maman quitta la chambre. Magali lut l'histoire et conclut que c'était un conte de fées typique : une princesse n'avait pour compagnie que son chien et s'ennuyait dans son palais. Sa marraine, la bonne fée, lui jeta un sort et transforma ses vêtements pour qu'elle ressemble à une villageoise. Cela lui permit de s'aventurer dans le village, où elle rencontra un prince qui, lui aussi, se déguisait pour explorer les royaumes voisins.\\

Elle trouva que c'était une sorte de Cendrillon à l'envers et ne fut pas vraiment impressionnée ; elle passa donc au coloriage. Mais, après deux dessins, elle jugea les illustrations peu intéressantes et décida de prendre les choses en main. Elle allait changer l'histoire et adapter les dessins à sa propre version du récit. Elle retourna aux pages précédentes et commença à rêvasser.\\

Elle changea la couleur de la robe de la princesse, passant du rose au noir avec des traits verts. Dans sa tête, la princesse était devenue l'ambassadrice d'une autre planète. Elle dessina un trait rouge qui s'étendait de la baguette magique de la marraine à la robe : c'était un rayon laser. La marraine était devenue vilaine et avait volé les vêtements de l'ambassadrice pour l'empêcher de retourner sur sa planète, car ses vêtements lui permettaient de se téléporter.\\

Magali bascula dans son monde imaginaire, où elle devint Célestine, l'ambassadrice interstellaire. Après avoir perdu ses vêtements, Célestine alla retrouver son gardien. Ce dernier avait pris l'apparence d'un chien, mais c'était en réalité un extraterrestre humanoïde, comme elle.\\

-- Éon ! cria-t-elle. On doit partir d'ici immédiatement ! Ce palais n'est plus sûr. J'ai découvert que les humains complotent pour envahir notre planète, et l'une d'eux m'a pris mon uniforme lorsqu'elle m'a repérée.\\

-- Je n'en crois pas mes oreilles, Dame Célestine ! répondit le chien avec horreur. Je vais contacter notre base aérienne pour les prévenir de notre arrivée !\\

Il se dirigea vers le miroir de la coiffeuse dans la chambre de l'ambassadrice et toucha la glace. Après quelques gestes, il se retrouva face à une personne de son espèce et lui expliqua brièvement ce qui s'était passé, avant d'informer qu'ils allaient rentrer plus tôt que prévu.\\

-- Nous devons nous rendre au village immédiatement, c'est là où j'ai planté la capsule d'urgence, dit-il à Célestine.\\

-- Allons-y !\\

Les deux s'échappèrent furtivement du palais et coururent vers le village. Une fois arrivés, ils ralentirent pour ne pas éveiller les soupçons des humains.\\

-- La capsule se trouve au fond du puits, dit Éon. C'est là que nous devons aller.\\

Ils se rendirent au centre du village, et Éon reprit son apparence humaine. Lui et la princesse firent semblant de se rencontrer et d'échanger quelques mots pendant qu'il sortait discrètement la capsule du puits. Ils étaient sauvés ! Ils montèrent à bord et quittèrent la Terre pour informer leur peuple des manigances humaines.\\

Magali sortit de son monde imaginaire et prit soin d'effacer le chien des images où le prince était présent ; dans sa version, c'était la même personne. Elle modifia également la tenue et dessina la capsule spatiale. Elle tourna les pages du livre et admira fièrement son œuvre. Les dessins étaient désormais plus excitants, pleins de couleurs vives, de noir et de gris pour les vêtements des extraterrestres et la capsule.\\

Maman revint avec un plateau contenant son goûter, prête à lui demander si elle avait aimé le livre, mais elle s'arrêta en voyant les coloriages.\\

-- Pourquoi ne t'es-tu pas basée sur les images de référence, ma chérie ? demanda-t-elle.\\

-- Parce que je n'ai pas trop aimé l'histoire, répondit Magali. Alors je l'ai changée.\\

Maman lui demanda de raconter sa version, et Magali le fit en utilisant ses dessins pour mieux expliquer. Maman l'applaudit et pensa qu'elle n'avait peut-être pas apporté le bon cadeau à son enfant. Le lendemain, elle lui offrit un carnet de feuilles blanches et lui dit :\\

Give me a reading comprehension exercise for a student learning French. It should have a subsection for answers.,"Maman ferma le livre d'histoire, le posa sur la table de chevet d'Angela et s'approcha d'elle pour lui embrasser le front.\\

-- Bonne nuit ma chérie, dit-elle en la couvrant avec sa couette.\\

Angela lui souhaita bonne nuit et la regarda éteindre la lumière avant de sortir en laissant la porte entre-ouverte. Elle leva la tête et se mit à admirer les étoiles lumineuses projetées par sa lampe, défilant lentement sur le plafond de sa chambre. En les regardant, Angela se rappela d'un détail tiré de l'histoire de cette nuit : un vieux nain avait dit au prince qu'un arc-en-ciel était en réalité un pont, un portail en quelque sorte, qui conduisait à un univers merveilleux où on pouvait trouver tout ce que l'on désire. Un monde fantastique de magie, de beauté et d'aventures.\\

Cette partie de l'histoire l'avait intéressée bien plus que le reste, et elle se demanda dans quel genre de monde elle atterrirait si elle venait un jour à croiser un arc-en-ciel. Y aurait-il des dragons ? Des fées ? Des sirènes ? Angela rêvassa un peu sur ce sujet avant de s'endormir avec un sourire rêveur.\\

Le matin, réveillée par son alarme bruyante, elle se rappela de ses rêves d'aventure. Elle aurait tellement aimé explorer de nouveaux mondes plutôt que d'aller en classe. Elle fit un vœu de voir un arc-en-ciel, sortit de son lit et alla se préparer. Une fois prête, elle salua ses parents, prit son petit-déjeuner, et se rendit à l'école. Sa journée était très ordinaire, sans événements particuliers. Elle suivit ses cours, joua avec ses amis à la récréation, et prit son déjeuner à la cantine.\\

À l'heure de rentrer, il se mit à pleuvoir, et Angela dut attendre car elle n'avait pas pris de parapluie. Surprise, elle se dit que c'était étrange pour une journée annoncée ensoleillée. Finalement, lorsque la pluie cessa, elle se mit en route pour chez elle. En évitant les flaques d'eau, elle aperçut le reflet de quelque chose de coloré dans l'une d'elles. Elle leva la tête et vit un arc-en-ciel. Ses yeux s'agrandirent d'émerveillement en se rappelant de ce qu'elle avait imaginé la veille au soir.\\

Angela regarda autour d'elle, mais il n'y avait personne pour partager sa joie. Elle soupira, se disant qu'il aurait été merveilleux de pouvoir traverser l'arc-en-ciel pour se retrouver dans un autre monde. Distraitement, elle traversa la flaque d'eau et se sentit soudain poussée par un vent violent qui la fit tomber.\\

-- Ouille ! s'écria-t-elle.\\

Elle ouvrit les yeux, mais resta allongée sur le sol, qui ne lui parut pas aussi dur qu'elle l'aurait cru. La première chose qu'elle vit était un ciel bleu clair qui passait graduellement à un rose pastel. Fronçant les sourcils, elle réalisa que le ciel était différent d'il y a deux minutes ! Elle aperçut trois grands cercles blancs presque transparents et entendit le bruissement des feuilles, le chant des oiseaux, et le doux ruissellement de l'eau. Elle se releva et découvrit avec stupéfaction qu'elle se trouvait dans une grande plaine couverte de fleurs et d'arbres, baignant dans des senteurs d'herbe et de fleurs qu'elle n'avait jamais rencontrées.\\

Elle remarqua qu'elle voyait, sentait et entendait tout avec une intensité décuplée. Quand elle se pencha sur une petite rivière pour boire, elle vit son reflet : ses cheveux avaient des reflets arc-en-ciel, et ses yeux verts brillaient d'un éclat vif. Ses vêtements avaient changé également, et elle portait une tunique bleue foncée, un pantalon blanc et des bottes marron.\\

Elle n'eut pas le temps de boire car son attention fut capturée par le reflet d'un dragon de feu volant au-dessus d'elle. Elle se tourna pour voir la créature et sentit sa chaleur passer dans l'air avec grâce.\\

-- Mais où suis-je ? murmura-t-elle, bouche bée.\\

-- Eh bien, à Galazio, évidemment ! répondit une voix joviale.\\

Angela sursauta, cherchant autour d'elle l'origine de cette voix.\\

-- Je suis là, un peu plus bas ! dit la voix.\\

Elle baissa les yeux et aperçut une minuscule femme assise sur le pétale d'un coquelicot. Bien qu'elle la voyait bien, Angela s'agenouilla pour observer de plus près.\\

-- Ne viens pas trop près, ou je vais attraper froid avec tes expirations ! rit la petite femme.\\

-- Vous… êtes une fée ? demanda Angela en s'éloignant.\\

-- Exactement !\\

Angela se présenta et la fée se nomma Emmeline, ou Em pour les intimes. Elles discutèrent, et Angela demanda s'il y avait d'autres créatures magiques sur Galazio. Em lui parla des dragons, des elfes, des licornes et même d'humains comme elle. Curieuse, Angela demanda si elle était censée combattre des créatures maléfiques, mais Em la rassura : Galazio était une planète paisible.\\

-- Peut-être que tu peux aller explorer des terres lointaines ? proposa Angela.\\

-- Je… ne pense pas. Cette planète est minuscule, répondit Em avec un sourire amusé. Mais tu peux aller à l'école !\\

Angela soupira.\\

-- Quand puis-je rentrer chez moi ? demanda-t-elle.\\

Em lui expliqua que les arcs-en-ciel, servant de portail, n'apparaissent qu'une fois tous les quinze jours. Déçue, Angela soupira. Em, cherchant à lui remonter le moral, lui proposa de faire le tour de Galazio et de se faire des amis en attendant.\\

Angela rencontra les dragons aux couleurs flamboyantes, les licornes aux crinières colorées, et les autres habitants de Galazio, tous bienveillants. Elle fut invitée à un grand dîner où elle découvrit que tout avait un goût plus prononcé ici. Elle dansa avec les enfants de Galazio, mais se sentit soudain triste en voyant les autres rentrer avec leurs parents.\\

-- Allez, viens ! Madame Maeva t'a préparé une chambre. Au lit ! dit Em.\\

Une fois dans son lit, Angela fixa le plafond, regrettant de ne pas y voir les étoiles de sa chambre. Elle se surprit à souhaiter se réveiller chez elle. Le lendemain, elle ouvrit les yeux et poussa un soupir en se voyant encore à Galazio. Elle rejoignit Em dans le jardin, mais un dragon de feu passa rapidement devant elle, et elle trébucha.\\

-- Attention ! cria la jeune fée.\\

Angela entendit la voix de Mme Rolland, son institutrice, et ouvrit soudain les yeux pour découvrir qu'elle était dans sa classe.\\

-- Je suis de retour, chuchota-t-elle, regardant ses vêtements d'uniforme. Quand la cloche sonna, elle courut chez elle et embrassa ses parents.\\

Il est vrai qu'il n'y avait ni dragons ni fées ici, mais elle était chez elle, et c'était tout ce qui comptait.

Une fois qu'ils arrivèrent au marché, le petit garçon sauta pratiquement hors de la voiture avant que son père ne put quitter son siège. Toby courut en avant et en se rappelant de son père, il s'arrêta brusquement. Il se retourna et regarda son père fermer la voiture avant de se tourner pour le regarder.

\textit{-Ne cours pas, mon grand. Tu risques de tomber et de te faire mal!} Son père marcha vers lui et prit sa main. \textit{Et ensuite, on va se faire gronder.} Il fit un clin d'œil à son fils avec un sourire. Toby rigola joyeusement. Le prospect de se faire gronder avec son père le rendit heureux et il pensa que cela le rendrait plus proche de son père. Comme des camarades qui auraient désobéi aux ordres et qui se feraient réprimander par leur supérieur. Mais, sa mère était plus belle qu'un supérieur en armée, bien évidemment!

Le petit garçon était plein d'enthousiasme en voyant les tables pleines de fruits et légumes colorés. Des tomates rouges vif, des cerises et des poivrons. Des pommes vertes, des brocolis, des asperges. Des oranges, des citrouilles, des aubergines, des myrtilles, des pommes de terre et des melons. Il y avait tous les légumes qu'il connaissait et même certains qu'il ne connaissait pas.

Certaines parties du marché étaient même dédiées aux poissons, épices, haricots et herbes. Lui et son père firent leur chemin à travers cet endroit en achetant ce qui était marqué dans leur liste de courses puis retournèrent à la voiture et mirent leurs sacs de légumes dans la malle.

Le supermarché était beaucoup moins excitant. Les produits étaient simplement présentés sur des étagères dans de différentes allées. Il n'y avait pas de tables avec des vendeurs qui bavardaient et riaient avec les clients mais il y avait quelques employés qui offraient des échantillons de dégustation de tartelettes et de sauces au fromage et d'autres produits du genre.

Toby était content d'y être cependant, car son père lui avait permis de choisir la marque des céréales et lui avait même acheté une barre de chocolat comme récompense pour être resté sage. Quand ils retournèrent à la maison, ils passèrent par une vente de garage que leur voisin tenait et encore une fois, Toby était intrigué par les gens qui s'étaient rassemblés autour des tables sur lesquelles différents objets étaient présentés.

Quand son père expliqua qu'une vente de garage était un moyen de se faire un peu d'argent et de se débarrasser des objets dont on n'a plus besoin, le petit garçon eut une idée. L'après-midi, quand Toby rencontra ses amis dehors, il leur parla de son idée.

\textit{-On devrait tenir un marché. On peut vendre des gâteries que nos mamans prépareraient ou des objets que l'on n'utilise plus.}

\textit{-Quels types d'objets?} Un de ses amis lui demanda.

\textit{-Des jouets. Des livres de coloriage. N'importe quel objet que tu n'utilises plus.} Il expliqua.

\textit{-Qui les achèterait? Je ne crois pas que les adultes voudront des jouets et les enfants n'ont pas beaucoup d'argent. Certains n'ont même pas d'argent de poche.} Une autre amie lui dit.

\textit{-On peut simplement faire des échanges. Si l'un de vous aime quelque chose que l'autre vend, il peut échanger avec lui un autre objet.} Toby dit ayant déjà pensé au manque d'argent.

\textit{-Les adultes n'achèteront peut-être pas de jouets mais ils achèteront des biscuits et du jus. Mon grand frère vendait de la limonade l'été dernier et il s'est fait assez d'argent pour acheter un nouveau téléphone.}

\textit{-Je pense que c'est une bonne idée. J'ai toujours voulu avoir un magasin de bouquins quand je serais grand et maintenant je peux commencer à m'entraîner.} Un autre enfant dit. Les autres enfants bavardèrent avec enthousiasme et ils étaient tous excités par leur petit projet.

\textit{-On doit demander la permission des adultes, par contre.} Toby dit. \textit{Et pas que nos parents, on doit voir si les voisins n'auront pas d'inconvénients.}

\textit{-Qu'est-ce qu'on va faire avec l'argent?} On lui demanda par la suite. Toby n'y avait pas pensé. Il était vrai qu'ils n'avaient besoin de rien puisque leurs parents prenaient soin de leur acheter tout ce dont ils avaient besoin et il pensa que leurs parents n'approuveraient pas qu'ils utilisent l'argent pour s'acheter des bonbons ou des jeux. Il savait que les adultes leur disaient toujours de ne pas gaspiller l'argent.

\textit{-On pourrait en faire un don aux enfants malades dans les hôpitaux.} L'un des garçons dit en haussant les épaules. \textit{N'est-ce pas ce que les scouts font quand ils vendent leurs biscuits? Ils font des dons et ils utilisent l'argent pour leurs programmes d'école, pas vrai?} Les enfants se mirent tous d'accord sur ce point et ils pensèrent tous que ça allait les aider pour convaincre leurs parents et le reste du quartier.

Les enfants se mirent d'accord et demandèrent la permission à leurs parents quand ils rentrèrent chez eux. Le jour suivant, ils se divisèrent et rendirent visite à leurs voisins pour demander leur permission pour établir leur petit marché de quartier et personne ne protesta. Certains offrirent même de préparer des gâteries pour qu'ils les vendent.

\textit{-Mme. Jordan fait le meilleur pain aux bananes! Ça va se vendre en un rien de temps.} Toby dit avec un grand sourire. Les enfants rassemblèrent les objets dont ils n'avaient plus besoin: des livres d'histoires, des livres de coloriage, des jouets, des affaires scolaires et même des vêtements. Certains avaient demandé à leurs parents de leur faire des gâteaux et certains préparèrent du jus tandis que d'autres préparèrent simplement des sandwiches et les voisins comme Mme. Jordan participèrent également en préparant de la nourriture ou en leur donnant des tables et des parasols pour le marché.

Le marché n'était pas trop large, juste trois tables qui avaient été installées dans l'aire de jeux du quartier et les enfants en étaient en charge. Toby échangea sa voiture télécommandée contre un beau T-shirt et l'une des filles acheta ses feutres en couleur. Les enfants qui vendaient de la nourriture offrirent des échantillons de dégustations et les adultes achetèrent du jus et des gâteaux pour eux et leurs enfants et tout le monde s'amusa. À la fin de la journée, l'argent qui avait été gagné fut compté et mit dans une grande enveloppe qui avait les noms de tous les enfants qui avaient organisé la vente écrits sur elle et ils l'envoyèrent au programme de charité pour enfants de l'hôpital.

Give me a reading comprehension exercise for a student learning French. It should have a subsection for answers.,"-- V-Valet ? s'écria Alexandre, stupéfait par ce qu'il venait d'entendre.\\

-- C'est exact… Êtes-vous sûr que vous vous sentez bien, messire ? demanda le monsieur en déposant les vêtements sur le lit.\\

-- Je… n'en sais rien, répondit Alexandre en passant la main dans ses cheveux. Excusez-moi, mais quel est votre nom ?\\

-- Samuel, dit le valet avec un regard curieux. Je crois que vous feriez mieux de vous recoucher, messire. Vous n'êtes clairement pas dans votre assiette.\\

Alexandre refusa mais lui dit qu'il préférerait s'habiller lui-même et lui demanda de sortir de la pièce. Une fois présentable, Alexandre sortit de sa chambre. Samuel l'attendait au bout du corridor et s'inclina devant lui avant de lui dire qu'il allait le conduire à la salle à manger pour le petit déjeuner. Samuel ajouta qu'ils partiraient ensuite au village pour récupérer sa nouvelle épée chez le forgeron, et Alexandre acquiesça avec incertitude.\\

Au salon, il rencontra trois hommes qui se levèrent à son entrée puis le saluèrent. Samuel lui murmura qu'ils étaient ses chevaliers. Surpris par l'information, Alexandre se demanda qui il était dans cet univers pour vivre dans un château, avoir un valet, une épée et des chevaliers. Sa question trouva réponse lorsqu'une des dames de cour entra et s'adressa à lui.\\

-- Messire, son altesse votre mère vous informe qu'elle arrivera de son voyage à temps pour le déjeuner.\\

Son altesse sa mère… il était donc un prince. Il tourna vers Samuel pour confirmer son hypothèse, et d'une voix basse, celui-ci lui dit :\\

-- Pas seulement un prince, messire. Vous êtes le gardien du royaume du damier.\\

Gardien du royaume du damier… Alexandre comprit que le nom du royaume venait de ses plaines, mais que voulait Samuel dire par “gardien” ? De quoi était-il censé garder le royaume ? Samuel interrompit ses pensées et lui dit qu'il était temps de partir pour le village. Ensemble, les deux se dirigèrent vers les écuries.\\

Au début, l'idée de monter sur un cheval rendit Alexandre anxieux. Il n'avait jamais fait quelque chose de pareil et passa quelques moments à penser à une bonne excuse pour éviter l'engagement. Mais, une fois face au bel étalon noir et après l'avoir caressé un peu, il changea d'avis. Il monta sur son cheval et Samuel fit de même avec sa jument. Ils échangèrent quelques mots de temps en temps pendant qu'ils trottaient vers leur destination, et une fois arrivés, Samuel lui dit qu'il allait vérifier si l'épée était prête.\\

Pendant les moments qu'il passa seul, Alexandre observa autour de lui. Il vit des villageois qui marchaient un peu partout, des vendeurs de fruits et légumes et divers magasins. Soudain, il entendit des cris de détresse. Son cheval sursauta et faillit le faire tomber. Il se retourna pour voir d'où venaient les hurlements, et ses yeux s'élargirent de surprise : des fourmis géantes piétinaient le village.\\

Samuel, attiré par le tumulte, sortit de l'atelier.\\

-- Messire ! cria-t-il, poussant Alexandre à faire tourner son cheval vers lui. Tenez ! dit-il en lui lançant une épée.\\

-- Mais qu'est-ce que je suis censé en faire ? dit Alexandre en l'attrapant maladroitement.\\

-- Utilisez-la pour chasser les fourmis ! Vous l'avez déjà fait, voyons !\\

-- Je vous assure que non ! Je n'ai aucune idée de comment m'y prendre !\\

-- J'ai foi en vous, messire ! Bonne chance ! dit Samuel avant de se sauver avec le reste des villageois.\\

Alexandre n'eut même pas le temps de réfléchir avant qu'une fourmi lui saute dessus. Par réflexe, il la bloqua et s'éloigna d'elle au galop. Surpris par sa capacité à brandir une épée, il la manipula et la fit tourner dans sa main un peu.\\

-- Tant pis, s'ils veulent que je sois le gardien, je vais être le gardien ! se dit-il avant de retourner au champ de bataille.\\

Bien qu'il l'ait fait avec hésitation au début, Alexandre se battit férocement et courageusement. Il lança des coups d'épée et fonça vers ses ennemis. Ses chevaliers ne tardèrent pas à le rejoindre et ensemble, ils chassèrent les fourmis hors du royaume.\\
Les villageois sortirent de leurs abris et les acclamèrent chaleureusement.\\

-- Vive le prince ! Vive les chevaliers ! Vive le royaume du damier ! criaient-ils avec joie.\\

De retour au château, les chevaliers et Samuel s'excusèrent de la grande salle pour laisser Alexandre parler avec la reine.\\

-- Maman ! s'écria le gardien lorsqu'il vit enfin un visage familier.\\

Il fit quelques pas pour embrasser sa mère, mais son élan fut interrompu par une soudaine sensation de vertige. La dernière chose qu'il entendit avant de perdre conscience fut la voix de sa mère.\\

-- Alexandre, Alexandre, Alex!...\\

Lorsqu'il ouvrit les yeux de nouveau, il se trouva face à face avec sa Maman. Elle lui caressait les cheveux et lui souriait.\\

-- Allez, debout petit paresseux. Tu ne veux plus faire de pique-nique ? lui demanda-t-elle. Papa va nous rejoindre d'un moment à l'autre. Il m'a appelé tout à l'heure et m'a dit qu'il avait fini de faire les courses.\\

Alexandre prit le temps de regarder autour de lui avant de se jeter dans les bras de sa mère. Il était de retour dans son monde. Ou plutôt, il s'était réveillé de son rêve.\\

-- Maman ! Tu ne vas pas croire tes oreilles lorsque je te raconte où j'étais ni ce que j'ai fait ! dit-il avec enthousiasme.\\

-- J'ai sauvé le royaume du damier des vilaines fourmis, Maman !!!\\

La mère d'Alexandre rigola et lui dit qu'il pourrait tout lui raconter pendant qu'ils déjeuneront.

Give me a reading comprehension exercise for a student learning French. It should have a subsection for answers.,"Un bel après-midi, trois chatons jouaient près de leurs jeunes propriétaires, qui écoutaient une histoire que leur mère leur racontait. C'était une histoire qui parlait des aventures d'un astronaute, et bien qu'ils ne prêtassent pas beaucoup d'attention à ce qu'elle disait, leur intérêt fut capturé lorsqu'ils entendirent les mots : \textit{voie lactée}.\\

-- La voie lactée ? dit Monocle, une adorable chatonne avec un œil encerclé de gris. Est-ce qu'elle veut dire un chemin couvert complètement de lait ?\\

Oto, le plus jeune d'entre eux, se redressa en imaginant ce qu'elle venait de dire, et Farfouille, leur grand frère, fixa ses yeux avec fascination.\\

-- Tu imagines si cet endroit existait vraiment ?\\

Les trois chatons furent transportés dans un univers fictif, où, dans un vaisseau spatial sombre et étroit, le commandant Farfouille, l'officier scientifique Oto, et la mécanicienne navigante Monocle étaient assis l'un à côté de l'autre. Ils naviguaient leur navette à travers le cosmos, sérieux et silencieux. Leur mission : trouver la voie lactée légendaire et en ramener des échantillons ; ils n'avaient pas l'intention d'échouer.\\

Ils s'arrêtèrent près d'une station spatiale pour s'informer sur le chemin à prendre et téléchargèrent un guide spatial qu'ils chargèrent dans le système de leur vaisseau. Après s'être assurés qu'ils avaient assez de carburant et de provisions, ils reprirent leur vol. Farfouille pilota l'engin, Oto fit des recherches sur leur destination, et Monocle surveilla la condition de la navette.\\

Au bout d'un moment, elle remarqua un point clignotant sur le radar et le signala à ses coéquipiers.\\

-- Doit-on les attaquer, commandant ? demanda-t-elle en se tournant vers Farfouille.\\

-- Hmm... Ce sont nos ennemis jurés, mais ils semblent se diriger vers une autre destination. Mieux vaut nous occuper de nos propres affaires et les ignorer, répondit le commandant sans quitter l'écran du radar des yeux.\\

-- Vous ne pensez pas qu'ils veulent goûter aux délices de la voie lactée eux aussi ? demanda Oto, sa queue frémissante.\\

-- Non, ils visent probablement le fromage de la Lune. Ils ont des goûts bien excentriques, répondit Farfouille.\\

-- N'oubliez pas que ces rats s'en prennent à tout, commandant. Ils viendront probablement vers nous après leur arrêt sur la Lune, ajouta Monocle.\\

-- Si c'est le cas, ils deviendront notre repas du soir, dit Farfouille d'un ton assuré.\\

Oto et Monocle hochèrent la tête et se concentrèrent sur leurs tâches, tandis que le commandant continuait à diriger le vaisseau vers la fameuse rivière de lait flottante, au beau milieu de l'espace. Les trois chatons étaient de fameux aventuriers de l'espace.\\

Farfouille, naturellement curieux et intrépide, aimait explorer l'univers ; Oto aimait apprendre et expérimenter ; et Monocle trouvait leurs aventures amusantes et saisissait toutes les occasions de bricoler à bord de la navette.\\

Une fois arrivés à destination, les trois chatons enfilèrent leurs combinaisons spatiales et descendirent du vaisseau. Ils flottèrent jusqu'à atteindre la rivière de lait miraculeuse. La voie lactée était majestueuse, son lait d'un blanc éclatant dégageait une douce lueur, illuminant l'espace alentour.\\

-- Chat-pristi ! murmura Oto, émerveillé.\\

-- Je n'en crois pas mes yeux, c'est incroyable ! s'exclama Monocle, tout à fait d'accord avec son frère.\\

-- Si seulement on pouvait enlever nos casques ! miaula Farfouille avec regret. On aurait pu goûter au lait directement de la source !\\

Oto tendit la patte pour toucher le lait et constata qu'il était agréablement chaud.\\

-- On dit que ce lait est infusé avec de la poussière d'étoile !\\

-- C'est donc pour ça qu'il brille autant !\\

-- Oui, et je pense que c'est aussi ce qui le garde à bonne température.\\

-- Trêve de bavardage ! les interrompit Farfouille impatiemment. Sortez les aspirateurs et commençons à remplir les réservoirs.\\

Oto et Monocle plongèrent de longs tubes-aspirateurs dans la rivière et commencèrent à pomper le lait vers les réservoirs de leur navette spatiale, tandis que Farfouille surveillait les niveaux. Soudain, Monocle aperçut un étrange signal sur son radar portable.\\

-- On dirait qu'un vaisseau s'approche à toute vitesse !\\

-- Restez ici, je vais vérifier sur le radar de bord. Je suis sûr que ce n'est rien, dit Farfouille.\\

Quelques instants plus tard, il ordonna à Oto et Monocle de retourner à bord du vaisseau.\\

-- C'est la navette des rats, ils viennent nous attaquer !\\

Lorsque les rongeurs approchèrent, Farfouille visa et commença à tirer sur eux avec les armes laser de la navette.\\

-- Monocle, tâche d'esquiver leurs attaques pendant qu'Oto et moi ripostons, ordonna Farfouille.\\

Comment osaient ces vermines les attaquer, et près de la voie lactée sacrée en plus ! Il n'était pas question de les laisser contaminer cette rivière de lait légendaire.\\

Après une longue bataille, les rats battirent en retraite, et la voie lactée fut sauvée par les courageux chatons de l'espace.\\

-- Mais qu'est-ce qu'ils font ? demanda une voix.\\

Les chatons relevèrent la tête et virent leurs jeunes propriétaires les regarder avec confusion. Monocle sortit de la boîte en carton où ils jouaient et se dirigea vers sa jeune humaine. Farfouille et Oto firent de même, et les trois chatons ronronnèrent sous les caresses affectueuses de leurs amis humains.\\

-- Allez, rentrons ! Je suis sûre qu'ils ont faim, donnons-leur un peu de lait, dit l'humaine de Monocle à ses frères.

Give me a reading comprehension exercise for a student learning French. It should have a subsection for answers.,"Marty était très content de passer la journée chez son ami. Les deux enfants passèrent la matinée à jouer au football dans le jardin et passèrent même un peu de temps avec le chien avant de rentrer dans la maison pour déjeuner. \\

Quand ils allèrent à l'étage dans la chambre de son ami pour passer le reste de la journée à jouer aux jeux vidéos, un petit carnet attira l'attention de Marty. \\

\textit{-C'est quoi ça, sur ton bureau ?} demanda-t-il en regardant l'objet. \\

\textit{-Oh ! C'est une collection de timbres,} son ami répondit. \textit{Mon père reçoit des lettres de partout dans le monde de ses correspondants. Je ne sais pas pourquoi ils n'utilisent pas simplement le téléphone ou les e-mails, mais à chaque fois qu'il reçoit une lettre, il me laisse prendre le timbre de l'enveloppe. Je les trouve très cool et donc j'ai commencé à les collectionner il y a environ un an. Jettes-y un coup d'œil si tu veux !} \\

Marty, intrigué par le concept de collectionner des petits morceaux de papier, accepta l'offre de son ami et commença à feuilleter les pages du carnet. \\

Il regarda les timbres avec fascination. Quelques-uns avaient des images de personnes sur eux, d'autres avaient des paysages tandis que certains avaient des machines, des trains et des animaux. \\

Il avait aimé les couleurs des timbres, mais ce qui l'intéressa le plus était la collection en elle-même. Les seules choses qu'il avait collectionnées dans sa vie étaient des armures dans un jeu et malgré qu'il s'en était vanté devant ses amis, il ne pensait pas que c'était aussi intéressant que la collection de timbres de son ami, qui resta dans sa tête jusqu'à ce qu'il rentre chez lui. \\

En réalité, il avait vraiment envie de commencer une collection à lui. Mais... que pouvait-il collectionner ? À ce qu'il savait, aucun de ses parents n'avaient de correspondants étrangers qui leur envoyaient des lettres et donc, il ne pouvait pas collectionner des timbres. \\

Il supposa qu'il pouvait collectionner ce qu'il voulait et c'était bien ça le problème, il n'avait aucune idée sur quoi choisir ! \\

Il s'installa devant son ordinateur et chercha quelques idées en ligne. \\

Certaines personnes collectionnaient des fleurs séchées, apparemment, ce qui ne l'intéressa pas vraiment car les seules fleurs qu'il y avait dans le jardin de sa maison étaient des roses. \\

Il trouva aussi des gens qui collectionnaient des pièces de monnaie provenant de différents pays, c'était intéressant mais il ne voyageait pas et donc cette option avait été abandonnée. \\

Certaines personnes collectionnaient des bandes dessinées et il pensa qu'il préférait regarder des dessins animés au lieu de lire des bandes dessinées et les acheter rien que pour les collectionner était du gâchis. \\

L'un des objets collectionnés les plus bizarres qu'il trouva étaient des papillons. \\

\textit{-Argh, c'est tellement flippant...} murmura-t-il à lui-même. \\

Il ne savait pas vraiment pourquoi les gens voudraient garder des cadavres de papillons chez eux, mais en y pensant, les collections de fleurs séchées étaient presque la même chose. \\

Il vit aussi qu'il était possible de collectionner des pierres minérales et des cristaux mais il n'était pas vraiment intéressé par ce type d'objets et il ne voulait pas aller en randonnée pour les trouver. \\

L'une des choses les plus intéressantes que les gens collectionnaient étaient les médailles et il trouva ça très cool, il les collectionnerait peut-être une fois que son équipe de foot à l'école commencerait les compétitions. \\

Pour l'instant, il allait continuer à chercher. \\

Dans un article, il lut qu'on pouvait collectionner n'importe quoi, du moment que c'est quelque chose que l'on aime et qu'il n'y avait pas de règles. \\

Les gens collectionnaient des trucs qu'ils aimaient et qui les amusaient. \\

Il passa quelques instants à penser à ce qu'il aimait le plus et les seules choses auxquelles il pouvait penser étaient les jeux vidéos, le football, le chocolat et le skating. \\

Il ne pouvait pas exactement collectionner les jeux vu qu'il les téléchargeait en ligne et le foot était un sport, pas quelque chose que l'on collectionne ! \\

Mais... il pouvait collectionner des ballons. \\

\textit{-Trop grands...} il se dit en secouant la tête. \\

Il n'avait pas assez d'espace dans sa chambre où il pourrait les garder. \\

La même chose s'appliquait pour les skateboards. \\

Et ils étaient trop chers en plus. \\

La seule chose qui restait était le chocolat. \\

Marty fronça les sourcils, ça serait vraiment du gâchis d'acheter des friandises juste pour les mettre dans une boîte, alors là le chocolat. \\

Et, pour être honnête, il ne se faisait pas confiance pour ne pas les manger immédiatement après les avoir achetées. \\

C'était juste trop bon ! \\

Par contre, le chocolat était très varié et avait beaucoup de formes et de parfums, les variétés étaient presque infinies ! \\

Et donc, ça serait quelque chose d'intéressant à collectionner. \\

Humm, que faire ? Il eut soudainement une idée qui pourrait régler ses problèmes. \\

Il pourrait simplement collectionner les emballages ! Oui, tous les types de chocolat étaient emballés ou dans une boîte. \\

Comme ça il pourrait manger le chocolat et collectionner les emballages. \\

Tout le monde gagne ! \\

\textit{-Je suis un génie !} il pensa avec fierté. \\

Il ouvrit un tiroir et y fouilla pour un moment avant d'en sortir une barre de chocolat qu'il y avait gardée. \\

\textit{-Ça va être le premier élément de ma collection,} dit-il avant d'aller sur son bureau et de prendre un carnet neuf. \\

\textit{-Je vais coller les emballages ici.} \\

Il avait pensé que l'idée de son ami de garder les timbres dans un carnet était intelligente et il voulait faire la même chose. \\

Il prépara du ruban adhésif et un feutre pour noter la date du jour et écrire une petite note et il déballa la barre de chocolat. \\

Il savoura son goût sucré et une fois qu'il en avait fini, il utilisa une lingette pour nettoyer les quelques endroits où il y avait du chocolat fondu collé à l'intérieur de l'emballage. \\

Une fois que le tout avait séché, il étendit l'emballage et le mit sur une page du carnet avant de l'y fixer avec du ruban adhésif. \\

Il écrivit avec son feutre sur la page sous l'emballage et ferma le carnet avec un sourire satisfait. \\

Il resta en place pour un moment avant de courir hors de sa chambre pour parler à ses parents de son nouveau loisir. \\

Après tout, il avait besoin de leur soutien pour acheter le chocolat et étendre sa collection ! \\

Ses parents étaient amusés et après qu'il eut promis d'être responsable et de ne pas manger trop de chocolat, ils approuvèrent.

La météo a annoncé qu'il allait peut-être pleuvoir aujourd'hui aussi,} Madame Sanders dit à sa fille depuis la cuisine en l'entendant ouvrir la porte. \\

\textit{-Oui, maman !} Amy répondit en prenant son parapluie du porte-manteau où il était posé. \\

La fillette mit ses bras dans les bretelles de son cartable et arrangea son bonnet en laine avant de quitter la maison. \\

En route vers l'école, elle chantonna doucement en sautant au-delà des flaques d'eau produites par la pluie de la nuit passée. \\

Elle regarda le ciel et vit les nuages gris qui indiquaient que sa mère avait raison de prêter tant d'attention à la météo. \\

Si les nuages dans le ciel indiquaient quoi que ce soit, c'était qu'il allait pleuvoir à travers la journée. \\

Amy commença à balancer son parapluie en pensant aux présentateurs de la météo. \\

Est-ce qu'ils devaient voyager partout à travers le monde pour voir quel temps il allait faire là-bas ? \\

Si c'était le cas, la petite fille pensa que c'était le travail le plus cool au monde. \\

Comme ça devait être super de voyager partout juste pour voir le ciel et de dire aux gens de ne pas oublier de mettre leurs manteaux ou d'annuler leurs plans de pique-nique ! \\

Ou bien, peut-être qu'ils allaient dans l'espace pour faire leur travail ? \\

C'était logique, vu qu'ils seraient plus capables de voir comment les nuages bougeaient d'en haut, n'est-ce pas ? \\

Ça aussi c'était très cool, par contre ! \\

Le fait de porter ces combinaisons d'espace et de monter sur une navette spatiale serait génial ! \\

Ou bien... est-ce qu'ils communiquaient simplement avec les extraterrestres qui leur disaient comment les choses allaient progresser sur terre ?! \\

Amy s'arrêta de marcher et laissa échapper un souffle en pensant à ça. \\

Si c'était le cas, alors les extraterrestres existent vraiment ! \\

Elle vit un groupe d'oiseaux voler loin de la ville et se souvint que leur enseignant leur avait dit une fois qu'ils migraient vers des régions plus chaudes. \\

Mais comment savaient-ils quand il allait faire plus froid ? \\

Avaient-ils des diffusions de météo aussi ? \\

Elle rigola et reprit son chemin. \\

Cette pensée était ridicule ! \\

Mais elle était très curieuse sur comment un présentateur de météo faisait son travail et elle décida de poser la question à son enseignant avant la récréation. \\

Une fois arrivée en classe, Amy compta les minutes avec impatience, ayant hâte de poser ses questions et de résoudre le mystère qu'elle avait en tête depuis ce matin. \\

Quand la cloche sonna enfin, elle se dirigea rapidement vers le bureau de l'enseignant et demanda quelques moments de son temps. \\

\textit{-Comment savent les présentateurs de la météo quand et où il va pleuvoir et quand il va faire beau et tout ?} demanda-t-elle quand il lui prêta son attention. \\

\textit{-Et bien, tout d'abord, tu dois connaître la différence entre un présentateur de météo et un météorologiste,} son enseignant lui dit avant de commencer son explication. \\

\textit{Les présentateurs de météo sont des gens qui présentent la météo à la télévision. Ils reçoivent des rapports et les lisent en indiquant des endroits du pays sur l'écran. Les météorologistes sont les gens qui préparent ces rapports. Ce sont des savants qui étudient le climat et la météo et font des prédictions sur quel temps il va faire au futur.} \\

Amy hocha la tête, intéressée. \\

\textit{-Et, comment font-ils ces prédictions ?} \\

\textit{-Ils utilisent des informations sur l'état de la météo au passé et mesurent son état actuel au présent et ils devinent son état au futur en se basant sur ça.} \\

Amy fronça ses sourcils, son enseignant n'avait pas vraiment tout expliqué. \\

\textit{-D'accord, mais comment est-ce qu'ils obtiennent les informations dont ils ont besoin ? Est-ce qu'il leur suffit de regarder le ciel ou...?} \\

\textit{-Oh ! Ils utilisent des outils comme des thermomètres pour mesurer la température, des baromètres pour mesurer la pression de l'air et des anémomètres pour mesurer la vitesse du vent.} \\

\textit{Ils utilisent aussi des images prises à partir de satellites pour observer la distribution des nuages dans le ciel.} \\

\textit{Quand ils ont les données nécessaires, ils les introduisent dans des ordinateurs qui utilisent des équations spéciales pour faire des calculs qui produisent par la suite des modèles qui les aident à prédire la météo.} \\

\textit{Ces modèles ne sont pas toujours précis par contre et les savants doivent les réviser pour voir s'ils sont cohérents ou pas.} \\

\textit{Il est très important que la météo soit aussi précise que possible parce que non seulement elle nous dit quand il va pleuvoir pour qu'on évite d'être trempés, elle nous prévient aussi quand il va y avoir de dangereux phénomènes comme des ouragans et elle nous aide à rester en sécurité.} \\

\textit{Les fermiers, les marins et les pilotes comptent beaucoup sur la météo dans leur travail et même les sportifs.} \\

Les yeux d'Amy s'élargirent par confusion. \\

\textit{-Comment est-ce que la météo peut affecter le travail de ces gens ?} \\

\textit{-Et bien, les fermiers ont besoin de savoir s'il va pleuvoir pour planter les graines appropriées.} \\

\textit{Quelques plantes grandissent dans des environnements pluviaux et d'autres ne peuvent pas survivre si le temps est trop humide.} \\

\textit{Les marins ont besoin de savoir s'il va y avoir des tempêtes pour prendre leurs précautions et rester en sécurité à la mer.} \\

\textit{Et c'est la même chose pour les pilotes, ils ne peuvent pas faire voler des avions dans des conditions météorologiques difficiles et les sportifs ne peuvent pas jouer comme il le faut sous la pluie.} \\

\textit{Tu imagines ce que ça ferait de jouer dans un terrain glissant ?} \\

Amy rigola en imaginant les grands joueurs de football américain que son père aimait regarder glisser dans la boue en courant à travers le terrain. \\

Elle n'aimerait pas être à leur place ! \\

Et rien qu'en pensant au mal de mer et à la nausée qu'on peut avoir en étant dans un bateau qui bascule la fit faire une grimace. \\

Elle n'avait jamais vraiment réalisé à quel point la météo était importante et malgré qu'elle était un peu déçue par le fait que ni les présentateurs ni les météorologistes ne voyageaient ni n'allaient dans l'espace pour faire leurs recherches, elle pensait quand même que c'était un métier très intéressant. \\

Tellement intéressant, d'ailleurs, qu'elle voulut en savoir plus et il n'y avait pas de meilleur endroit pour commencer que la bibliothèque. \\

\textit{-Merci beaucoup pour vos explications, Monsieur Brown !} dit-elle avec enthousiasme avant de prendre sa carte de bibliothèque et de courir hors de la salle de classe. \\

Elle avait juste assez de temps pour obtenir quelques livres avant la fin de la récréation !

Give me a word problem for a 6th grade student learning mathematics. It should have a subsection for answers.,"Jason sold \(\frac{3}{10}\) as many pens as Mike. If Jason sold 210 fewer pens than Mike, how many pens did they sell altogether?

\subsection*{Answers}
Let \( x \) be the number of pens Mike sold. Then, Jason sold \(\frac{3}{10}x\) pens. According to the problem, we have the equation:

\[
\frac{3}{10}x = x - 210
\]

Solving for \( x \):

\[
\frac{3}{10}x + 210 = x
\]
\[
210 = x - \frac{3}{10}x
\]
\[
210 = \frac{7}{10}x
\]
\[
x = 210 \times \frac{10}{7} = 300
\]

So, Mike sold 300 pens, and Jason sold:

\[
\frac{3}{10} \times 300 = 90
\]

Altogether, they sold:

\[
300 + 90 = 390 \text{ pens.}

Il tourna vers ses camarades de garderie et les regarda avec curiosité. Comment pouvaient-ils continuer à jouer avec une telle indifférence ?\\
C'est comme s'ils s'étaient résignés à l'ennui, un truc qu'il ne pouvait accomplir.\\
Il jeta un dernier regard hors de la fenêtre, à l'aire de jeux qui se tenait sous la pluie, et haussa les épaules.\\
Tant pis, il n'aura qu'à penser à autre chose pour faire passer le temps.\\

Il regarda autour de lui et vit Damien qui jouait avec les petits soldats.\\
Il se dirigea vers lui et lui tapota l'épaule. Une fois qu'il eut son attention, il lui dit qu'il en avait assez de rester à l'intérieur sans rien faire d'amusant.\\

-- On peut jouer à cache-cache avec les autres, si tu veux ? suggéra Damien.\\

Lucien n'était pas vraiment intéressé au vieux jeu. Il voulait vivre une aventure, sentir la joie et l'excitation de l'inconnu.\\

-- Non…\\

Il prit une pause, réfléchit un moment puis dit à Damien :\\

-- J'ai une meilleure idée. Aide-moi à rassembler les autres.\\

Lorsque tout le monde fut réuni, Lucien leur demanda de s'asseoir en cercle puis commença à parler avec un ton sérieux.\\

-- On va jouer au village maudit, leur annonça-t-il.\\
Il s'agit d'un village envahi par les ogres et les sorcières.\\
Les villageois doivent se cacher et éviter de se faire attraper par les ogres pour enfin aller au château et alerter les soldats et sauver le village,\\
expliqua Lucien en montrant les soldats que Damien avait alignés.\\
-- Ils doivent souvent changer de cachette car les ogres peuvent les renifler s'ils restent dans le même endroit trop longtemps.\\
Et quoi qu'il arrive, ils ne doivent jamais laisser une sorcière leur mettre la main dessus.\\

Il désigna à chacun son rôle.\\

-- Pierre, Éloïse et Manon sont les ogres.\\

-- Hé ! Mais je ne veux pas être une ogresse ! protesta Manon.\\

-- C'est comme ça. Tu seras la princesse dans la prochaine partie, lui dit Lucien.\\

La fillette, étant la plus jeune du groupe et donc la plus naïve, ne s'était pas rendu compte qu'il n'y avait pas de princesse dans le jeu, et se contenta de jouer le rôle de l'ogresse pour le moment,\\
permettant à Lucien de continuer.\\

-- Damien, moi et Sabine sommes les villageois.\\

Sabine, confuse par l'affectation des rôles, lui demanda qui joueront les rôles des sorcières puisque tout le monde avait déjà un rôle.\\
Lucien se pencha vers le groupe d'enfants et dit d'une voix basse et menaçante :\\

-- Les sorcières… c'est les aides maternelles !\\

Le groupe laissa échapper quelques exclamations et cris de surprise avant de se lever et partir assumer leurs positions.\\

Les ogres dormirent pendant que les villageois allèrent se cacher.\\
Lucien se plongea dans le monde qu'il venait de créer.\\

Désormais, sa crèche ressemblait aux bois médiévaux qu'on trouve dans les contes de fées et lui-même se voyait vêtu d'un pantalon moulant marron, d'une cotte-hardie verte et chaussé d'une paire de bottes usées.\\
Il courut, essoufflé, et se cacha derrière un arbre.\\
Il jeta un coup d'œil furtif pour voir si les ogres s'étaient réveillés et vit qu'en effet, ils l'étaient.\\
Il les guetta et les vit en train de marcher dans différentes directions, s'arrêtant pour chercher derrière des arbres ou à l'intérieur des grottes.\\

À un moment, lorsqu'il vit que les ogres lui tournaient le dos, il fila à toute vitesse pour changer d'abri.\\
Son cœur battait la chamade et il était trempé de sueur lorsqu'il s'accroupit derrière un buisson.\\
Il écarta son feuillage et vit Damien qui essayait de se faufiler derrière les grandes bêtes, mais par malchance,\\
celui-ci ne vit pas la pièce de Lego--plutôt la branche qui était sur son chemin et marcha dessus, alertant les ogres de sa présence.\\

Lucien, souhaitant sauver son ami, prit une des baies du buisson et la jeta sur l'ogre le plus proche de Damien, détournant son attention et permettant à l'autre villageois de s'enfuir à temps.\\
Lucien profita de la confusion pour changer, lui aussi, de cachette.\\
Il grimpa sur un arbre et regarda du haut de son perchoir pour voir comment les autres s'en sortaient.\\

Damien se tenait debout derrière un arbre, inaperçu par les ogres, et Sabine tentait de changer de cachette mais sans succès.\\
Lorsqu'elle se jeta enfin dans la gueule du loup, la plus jeune ogresse lui mit la main dessus.\\

Navré par le sort de sa voisine, Lucien secoua la tête avant de se rappeler qu'il devait changer de cachette avant qu'il ne se fasse repérer.\\
En se dirigeant vers un autre arbre, il vit du coin de l'œil que Damien aussi s'était fait capturer.\\

Malgré sa tristesse, il savait qu'il devait continuer, ne serait-ce que pour sauver le village. Trois contre un, ses chances de survie étaient minces, mais il refusait de renoncer à sa quête.\\

Il respira profondément avant de foncer vers les soldats.\\
Il était si proche ! Il allait y arriver ! Ses jambes ne le tenaient plus, ses poumons brûlaient et le vent soufflait contre lui mais rien ne l'arrêta.\\

À deux pas des soldats, il heurta un grand mur qui apparut de nulle part.\\
L'impact le lança à terre et il entendit Sabine s'exclamer :\\

-- Non ! La sorcière l'a eu !\\

Expulsé de son monde fantastique, Lucien fit un petit sourire penaud à son institutrice avant de s'excuser.\\

-- Ce n'est pas grave, dit-elle avec un sourire.\\
-- Je suis venue vous chercher pour le déjeuner.\\
Il y a une soupe de citrouille dans le chaudron qui n'attend que vous !\\

Give me a reading comprehension exercise for a student learning French. It should have a subsection for answers.,"Sous le soleil brillant de l'été, deux filles jouaient joyeusement ensemble à la marelle. Charlotte et Ines étaient meilleures amies. Elles étaient inséparables et se sentaient chanceuses d'être dans la même classe et d'habiter dans le même quartier. Elles se connaissaient depuis leurs jours passés dans le bac à sable et s'imaginaient qu'elles resteraient meilleures amies jusqu'à la mort. Les deux filles s'aimaient beaucoup et étaient proches comme des sœurs.\\

Ce matin, Ines avait ramené de la craie et proposé à sa copine de jouer au fameux jeu. Charlotte accepta avec enthousiasme et se mit à chercher un caillou pendant qu'Ines traçait le plateau de jeu. Une fois que tout était prêt, leur partie commença. Ines jeta le caillou sur la première case et commença à faire le parcours à cloche-pied. Lorsqu'elle fit son retour et tenta de lancer le caillou sur la deuxième case, celui-ci atterrit sur la troisième, et elle passa son tour.\\

Un peu plus tard, quand Ines prit de nouveau son tour, Charlotte interrompit son parcours en lui disant qu'elle avait marché sur le trait.\\

-- Mais non, j'étais assez loin des bords de la case, protesta Ines.\\

-- Mais si, tu ne l'as peut-être pas vu toi-même, mais d'où je suis, c'était clair que tu avais marché dessus ! insista Charlotte.\\

-- Tu es sûre que tu ne dis pas ça juste pour avoir ton tour ? dit Ines, plissant les yeux avec suspicion.\\

-- Bien sûr que non, comment peux-tu dire ça ! répondit Charlotte en fronçant les sourcils.\\

Leur discussion se transforma vite en conflit, et les deux filles finirent par se disputer. Par entêtement, aucune d'elles ne quitta l'aire de jeux ni ne continua à jouer. Elles s'assirent, le dos tourné l'une vers l'autre, boudant en silence, jusqu'à ce qu'une vieille dame vînt les saluer.\\

-- Bonjour Ines, bonjour Charlotte. Comment allez-vous, mes petites ?\\

-- Bonjour, Madame Morel, dirent-elles en même temps, ajoutant qu'elles allaient bien avant de lui demander de ses nouvelles.\\

-- Je vais bien, merci, sourit Mme Morel gentiment. J'étais en train de ranger mon grenier, et je me demandais si vous voudriez bien me donner un coup de main. Peut-être y trouverez-vous quelque chose qui vous plairait, même si ça date de plusieurs décennies.\\

Bien qu'elles ne se parlent pas, et malgré leur mauvaise humeur, les deux filles étaient trop polies pour refuser d'aider leur vieille voisine et acceptèrent de l'aider.\\

-- Excellent, je vous remercie ! Je vais passer un coup de fil à vos mères pour les informer que vous êtes chez moi, dit Mme Morel, leur promettant aussi des brownies en récompense.\\

Une fois chez la vieille dame, les deux filles commencèrent à trier les objets du grenier, mettant d'un côté ce qui devait être jeté et de l'autre ce qui pourrait encore servir. Elles ne savaient pas si Mme Morel voulait garder, donner, ou vendre ces objets, alors elles préféraient la laisser décider. Pendant une demi-heure, elles ne se dirent pas un mot, jusqu'à ce que Mme Morel vînt vérifier si tout allait bien.\\

-- Faites attention ! Aidez-vous pour soulever les objets lourds, sinon vous risquez de vous blesser, leur dit-elle avant de les rejoindre dans le ménage du grenier.\\

Avec leur vieille voisine dans la pièce, les deux filles commencèrent à se parler, ne serait-ce que pour demander de l'aide de temps en temps. Quelques instants plus tard, Mme Morel les appela pour voir le contenu d'une boîte en carton.\\

-- Ce sont vos jouets ? demanda Charlotte en saisissant une petite poupée.\\

-- Certains, oui. D'autres étaient ceux de mes enfants, répondit Mme Morel avec un sourire nostalgique. Ça, par exemple, dit-elle en leur montrant un gros ressort coloré, appartenait à ma fille aînée, Marie.\\

Elle tendit le ressort à Ines, qui le regarda avec fascination avant de le passer à son amie.\\

-- Et ce jeu de dominos appartenait à mon plus jeune fils, ajouta-t-elle en sortant une petite boîte en bois.\\

-- Et ça ? dit Charlotte en pointant un petit livret du doigt.\\

-- Ah ! s'exclama Mme Morel avec joie en sortant le livret de la boîte. C'est un album photo rempli de souvenirs avec ma meilleure amie.\\

Mme Morel ouvrit le petit album et leur montra des photos d'elle et de son amie d'enfance, capturant des moments de leur enfance jusqu'à l'adolescence.\\

-- Vous aviez l'air tellement heureuses ! s'exclama Ines, trouvant les sourires des deux filles dans les photos contagieux.\\

-- On l'était, dit la vieille dame doucement. On était aussi proches que vous l'êtes aujourd'hui.\\

Charlotte, remarquant que Mme Morel avait conjugué son verbe au passé, lui demanda si elles avaient perdu contact.\\

-- Non, nous sommes restées meilleures amies jusqu'à la fin. L'an dernier, mon amie est décédée.\\

-- Oh…\\

Charlotte se sentit coupable d'avoir rappelé quelque chose de triste à Mme Morel et baissa les yeux.\\

-- Je suis désolée, dit-elle.\\

-- Ce n'est pas ta faute, ma chérie. Et puis, nous avons eu toute notre vie pour nous aimer et nous amuser, dit la vieille dame en prenant les deux filles dans ses bras. Maintenant, c'est à votre tour de vous faire de bons souvenirs.\\

Ines et Charlotte se regardèrent timidement, un peu embarrassées par leur dispute, et échangèrent un sourire. Petit à petit, elles recommencèrent à se parler comme les meilleures amies qu'elles étaient.\\

-- Regarde ça ! dit Ines à sa copine en lui montrant une paire de raquettes de plage.\\

-- Oh ! Tu crois que Mme Morel nous laissera les garder ?\\

La dame en personne les rejoignit avec un plateau contenant deux grands verres de lait et une assiette remplie de brownies.\\

-- Bien sûr que vous pouvez les garder !\\

Give me a reading comprehension exercise for a student learning French. It should have a subsection for answers.,"Stéphanie fit tambouriner ses doigts sur son bureau, les yeux fixés sur la feuille blanche qui était posée au centre avec un stylo au-dessus. \\
\textit{-Mais qu'est-ce que je dois choisir ?} se demanda-t-elle en se penchant en arrière sur sa chaise avec un soupir. \\
Elle devait écrire un texte dans lequel elle décrit sa saison préférée et explique pourquoi elle l'aime tellement. C'était un devoir que leur enseignant leur avait demandé de faire et de rendre le lendemain. \\
Pour Stéfy, les expressions écrites étaient faciles et amusantes à faire, d'ailleurs c'était une des rares choses qu'elle aimait avoir comme devoir. \\
Le seul problème était qu'elle ne savait pas quoi choisir, elle aimait toutes les saisons et n'avait pas une qu'elle préférait. N'était-ce pas le but d'avoir quatre saisons en rotation, après tout, d'avoir l'occasion et le plaisir de les vivre toutes ? \\

Elle aimait la progression naturelle des saisons, elle aimait le froid et la pluie de l'hiver, les couleurs du printemps, la joie de l'été et la douceur de l'automne. \\
Après quelques moments de réflexion, elle décida de demander à ses parents quelle était leur saison préférée en espérant que ça l'aiderait à décider. \\
Papa avait dit qu'il aimait l'hiver et lorsque Stéfy lui avait demandé pourquoi pas les autres saisons, il avait dit que son allergie au pollen rendait le printemps pénible, qu'il y avait trop de mouches en automne et qu'il faisait trop chaud pendant l'été.\\
Maman avait choisi l'été simplement parce qu'elle pouvait faire la grasse matinée et ne devait pas se lever tôt pour préparer le petit déjeuner et conduire sa fille à l'école. \\

Pas vraiment convaincue par les raisons de ses parents, qui semblaient être plus pratiques qu'amusantes, Stéphanie alla parler avec ses amis. \\
Tous sauf un lui avaient dit qu'ils préféraient l'été parce que c'est la saison des vacances et qu'ils pouvaient jouer à volonté, n'avaient pas de devoirs, et en plus ils pouvaient aller à la plage. \\
Le dernier lui avait dit qu'il aimait l'automne parce qu'il aimait voir les feuilles des arbres changer de couleur et le vol des oiseaux qui partent en migration vers des régions plus chaudes. \\
Lorsqu'il lui demanda pourquoi elle voulait savoir, elle lui expliqua son problème. \\

\begin{quote}
\textit{-Je vois, alors ton souci c'est que tu ne peux pas faire un choix, c'est ça ?}\\
\textit{-Oui.}\\
\textit{-Alors, pourquoi n'écris-tu pas un texte qui contient toutes les saisons ? Une saison quatre-en-un en quelque sorte,} suggéra-t-il.
\end{quote}

Stéphanie tapota son doigt sur son menton et prit quelques instants pour penser à l'idée de son ami. \\
Ce n'était pas mal comme suggestion et l'enseignant n'avait pas précisé de règles qui pouvaient l'empêcher de le faire. Et puis, plus elle y pensait, plus elle avait envie de le faire, elle trouvait ça amusant d'imaginer une saison qui regroupe les quatre qui existent. \\
Elle remercia son ami puis rentra chez elle pour commencer son travail. \\

Elle s'assied sur sa chaise de bureau, ferma les yeux et commença à imaginer son monde où les saisons étaient fusionnées en une seule. \\
Elle imagina une belle forêt où les arbres avaient un feuillage tantôt vert de printemps, tantôt doré d'automne, certains arbres étaient recouverts de neige et d'autres portaient des fruits mûrs. \\
On y entendait le chant des oiseaux et des criquets, et on pouvait voir des abeilles et des papillons butiner les fleurs et les baies sur les buissons. Il ne faisait ni trop froid, ni trop chaud.\\

Stéphanie ouvrit soudainement les yeux et secoua la tête. \\
\begin{quote}
\textit{-Non, ce n'est pas vraiment excitant de mélanger le tout…} murmura-t-elle.
\end{quote}

Elle prit une pause et alla à la cuisine pour prendre son goûter et son regard fut capturé par l'assiette compartimentée qui contenait des condiments : il y avait de la mayonnaise, du ketchup, de la moutarde et du houmous. \\
En la regardant, Stéfy se demanda à quoi ressemblerait sa forêt imaginaire si elle était divisée comme cette assiette, avec les saisons à la place des condiments. \\

Elle s'assied sur l'une des chaises de la cuisine et se replongea dans son monde.\\
Si elle pouvait voir la forêt de haut, elle aurait pu remarquer que celle-ci avait des bordures distinctes cette fois : on pouvait clairement voir où une partie se termine pour laisser place à une autre. \\
Elle commença à explorer cet endroit et ne tarda pas à constater qu'elle était dans la partie où le printemps dominait. Il y avait plein de couleurs, l'air était frais et les sons des animaux animaient l'endroit. \\
Elle vit un écureuil courir d'un arbre à un autre et le suivit. \\

Lorsqu'elle le vit grimper, son attention fut détournée vers les pommes suspendues sur une branche et elle sentit un changement subtil dans la température de l'air. \\
\begin{quote}
\textit{-Ah, je vois, c'est l'été ici…} dit-elle avant de continuer en avant.
\end{quote}

Elle leva le bras pour se protéger les yeux des rayons de soleil qui transperçaient les feuilles des arbres, dessinant des motifs mystérieux avec des ombres et des lumières sur le sol. Un vent soudain la fit marcher plus rapidement et elle baissa son bras lorsqu'elle entendit le son des feuilles mortes sur lesquelles elle marchait. \\
Les arbres étaient à présent vêtus de feuilles jaunes, oranges, rouges et marrons, et elle sentit une odeur agréable de terre humide et de champignons. \\
Elle se pencha au bord d'une rivière et retira sa main aussitôt qu'elle l'étendit pour toucher l'eau. Elle regarda l'autre côté de la rivière et vit que les arbres étaient dévêtus de leurs feuillages et recouverts d'une épaisse couche de neige. \\

Lorsqu'elle ouvrit les yeux, elle sourit et prit une brioche au chocolat avant de retourner dans sa chambre pour transformer ses pensées en mots. \\

Le lendemain, lorsqu'elle lut son expression écrite, toute la classe, y compris son enseignant, l'applaudit chaleureusement, et tout le monde exprima son envie de visiter sa forêt quatre-saisons.

\begin{enumerate}

Give me a reading comprehension exercise for a student learning French. It should have a subsection for answers.,"Eleanor tapota ses doigts sur son bureau en observant la progression de ses téléchargements sur l'écran de son ordinateur. \\
Elle avait trouvé de très bons jeux en ligne et elle pensait qu'elle allait pouvoir s'amuser en y jouant et passer le temps durant ses vacances d'été quand il ferait trop chaud pour sortir jouer dehors. \\
Cependant, après avoir vu les descriptions des jeux, elle devint surexcitée et voulut les essayer immédiatement. \\
Le seul problème était qu'ils prenaient trop de temps pour se télécharger et elle commença à perdre patience. \\

\textit{-Arrghhh !} elle cria avec frustration. \textit{Allez ! Plus rapidement, je vous en supplie !} \\

Sa grande sœur qui passait devant sa chambre à ce moment-là devint curieuse et frappa sur la porte ouverte de sa chambre. \\
\textit{-Est-ce que je peux entrer ?} demanda-t-elle. \\
\textit{-Bien sûr...} répondit Eleanor avec distraction. \\

\textit{-Qu'est-ce qui se passe, Elle ?} sa sœur demanda en s'asseyant sur le bord de son lit. \\
\textit{-C'est juste cette stupide connexion internet qui est trop lente ! J'attends le téléchargement de ces fichiers depuis des lustres !} La fillette répondit avec rage. \\

\textit{-Tu es en train de télécharger des fichiers ? Est-ce qu'ils proviennent d'une source sécurisée ?} sa sœur demanda en mettant une mèche de ses cheveux derrière son oreille et en se penchant en avant pour regarder l'écran de l'ordinateur. \\

Eleanor haussa ses épaules et dit qu'elle n'avait pas vérifié la source en réalité. \\
\textit{-Je ne connais même pas la différence entre une source qui est sécurisée et une autre qui ne l'est pas.} \\

\textit{-Eh bien, laisse-moi te montrer.} Sa sœur se leva et se mit derrière sa chaise avant de se pencher en avant et de prendre la souris. \\
Elle alla sur un site et utilisa le curseur de la souris pour montrer la partie supérieure du navigateur où le lien du site était écrit. \\

\textit{-Tu vois ce cadenas ? Ça veut dire que le site sur lequel tu es est sûr et vérifié. Tout ce que tu télécharges depuis ce site ne va pas faire de mal à ton ordinateur,} elle l'informa avant de lui demander d'aller sur le site depuis lequel elle avait téléchargé ses jeux. \\

\textit{-Regarde ! Il y a un cadenas vert !} La fillette dit en montrant du doigt l'icône en question. \\

Sa sœur hocha la tête avant de fermer l'onglet. \\
\textit{-Oui, ce site est aussi sécurisé. Donc, tes jeux ne sont pas dangereux.} \\

Eleanor hocha la tête, ayant compris. \\
\textit{-Qu'est-ce qui se passerait si je télécharge des trucs à partir de sites non vérifiés ?} \\

\textit{-Eh bien, ça dépend. Parfois, rien de grave. Si tu as de la chance, rien de mauvais ne se passe, mais parfois tu peux avoir des virus sur ton système.} \\

Eleanor pencha la tête curieusement sur le côté et demanda à sa sœur ce qu'était un virus et comment cela fonctionnait. \\
\textit{-J'entends toujours les gens en parler, mais je n'ai jamais compris ce qu'est vraiment un virus d'ordinateur.} \\

\textit{-Bon alors, un virus d'ordinateur est un type de logiciel malveillant.} \\
\textit{Comme d'autres logiciels de ce genre, les virus sont des programmes qui s'exécutent avec d'autres programmes.} \\

\textit{Dans notre cas, un virus pourrait s'exécuter avec l'un des jeux que tu es en train de télécharger et se copier sur ton système.} \\
\textit{Il peut exécuter des instructions dangereuses qui peuvent endommager tes fichiers et ralentir ton ordinateur.} \\

\textit{-Oh ! C'est ce qui se passe quand on attrape froid, n'est-ce pas ? Ça rentre dans nos corps et nous rend malade et alités,} la petite fille remarqua. \\

\textit{-Oui ! En fait, c'est la raison pour laquelle ce type de logiciel malveillant est nommé un virus.} \\
\textit{Car ça marche de la même manière qu'un virus de rhume ou de grippe,} sa sœur lui dit. \\

\textit{-Tu continues à répéter les mots “ce type de logiciel malveillant”, quels sont les autres types ?} Eleanor demanda en se penchant en avant dans sa chaise. \\

\textit{-Eh bien, il y a plusieurs autres types. L'un d'eux est un type qu'on appelle un cheval de Troie.} \\
\textit{Connais-tu l'histoire du cheval de Troie dans l'histoire ?} \\

Eleanor secoua la tête, indiquant que non. \\
\textit{-Bon, dans la mythologie grecque, on dit que la femme du roi de Sparte, Hélène, avait été kidnappée et emmenée à Troie.} \\
\textit{Ceci poussa le roi à demander de l'aide auprès des Grecs qui acceptèrent d'aller au secours d'Hélène.} \\

\textit{Mais, la cité de Troie était protégée par de grands murs et on ne pouvait pas y accéder facilement et donc le général Grec Ulysse pensa à jouer un tour pour s'y introduire et sauver Hélène avec ses guerriers.} \\

\textit{Et donc, les Grecs bâtirent un immense cheval en bois et le laissèrent hors du portail de Troie en guise d'offrande et l'armée fit semblant de battre en retraite.} \\

\textit{Les gens de Troie, contents de leur victoire, tirèrent le cheval à l'intérieur de la cité et le mirent au centre pour que tout le monde puisse l'admirer.} \\

\textit{La nuit, quand tout le monde dormait, quelques guerriers qui étaient cachés à l'intérieur du cheval en sortirent et ouvrirent les portails de Troie pour le reste de l'armée et à partir de là, tu peux facilement deviner qui avait gagné cette guerre.} \\

Eleanor écouta l'histoire avec fascination avant de demander quel lien ça avait avec le logiciel malveillant. \\
\textit{-Le cheval de Troie marche d'une façon semblable.} \\
\textit{Il se fait passer pour un logiciel inoffensif pour te pousser à le télécharger et l'installer et une fois sur ton système, il peut donner accès aux attaquants à tes fichiers et ils pourront t'espionner, voler tes fichiers et même télécharger plus de logiciels malveillants sur ton ordinateur.} \\

\textit{-Oh... C'est horrible !} Eleanor dit en regardant l'écran de son ordinateur. \\

Ses téléchargements étaient toujours en cours et elle retourna son attention sur sa sœur. \\
\textit{Comment pourrais-je protéger mon ordinateur des logiciels malveillants ?} \\

\textit{-Tu peux utiliser un logiciel antivirus.} \\

Give me a reading comprehension exercise for a student learning French. It should have a subsection for answers.,"Jennie, Marshall et Ophelia se rassemblèrent au centre de la maison. Chaque fin de semaine, ils incitaient leur mère à sortir avec ses amies et à se détendre pendant qu'ils nettoyaient la maison avec l'aide de leur père et sous sa surveillance.

\textit{-Alors voilà, puisqu'on est à court de certaines choses, Papa est sorti acheter ce dont on a besoin mais on peut quand même diviser les tâches maintenant.} Ophelia, l'aînée, dit sur un ton enfantin mais ferme. Son frère et sa sœur hochèrent la tête en accord et attendirent qu'elle délégua leurs tâches.

\textit{-Comme d'habitude, Papa va s'occuper des cuvettes, fenêtres et miroirs.} Elle commença. \textit{Jennie, tu as fait la vaisselle la semaine passée, donc Marshall va faire cela cette semaine.} Dit-elle à sa sœur. \textit{Tu vas passer l'aspirateur au salon et au couloir tandis que je m'occupe du linge et je vais aussi faire le parterre de la cuisine. Est-ce que tout le monde a compris?} Encore une fois, les enfants les plus jeunes hochèrent leurs têtes.

À peine un moment plus tard, leur père ouvrit la porte et ils se dirigèrent tous vers la cuisine pour leurs nouveaux produits de nettoyage. Marshall prit une paire de gants et une bouteille de savon à vaisselle.

\textit{-Est-ce que je peux aussi remplacer la vieille éponge? Elle est devenue dégueulasse.} Il demanda à son père qui hocha la tête.

\textit{-Je vais aussi changer la brosse des toilettes. Il est bien de changer les outils fréquemment, plus ils deviennent usés plus ils contiennent de bactéries.} Son père dit en prenant deux flacons vaporisateurs, une brosse, une paire de gants et un masque qui le protégerait des produits chimiques qui étaient dans les produits de nettoyage. Jennie, qui était chargée de passer l'aspirateur, prit également un des masques pour se protéger de la poussière.

Et quand tout le monde avait ce dont ils avaient besoin, ils se tapèrent les mains et se mirent au travail.

\textit{-Allez, les enfants. Montrons à Maman comment le nettoyage professionnel se fait!} Leur père dit. Le seul qui resta dans la cuisine était Marshall vu qu'il était celui qui allait faire la vaisselle. La première chose qu'il fit était de porter le tablier à froufrous de sa mère vu que celui de son père était trop grand pour lui. Il tourna et rigola en voyant le tablier se bouffer autour de lui. Puis, il glissa ses mains dans les gants en caoutchouc et remplit la cuvette d'eau avant d'ajouter le savon à vaisselle.

Il agita ses mains dans l'eau jusqu'à ce qu'elle devienne mousseuse et pleine de bulles et il s'amusa à faire de petites formes avec la mousse et à souffler sur les bulles. Il commença à chantonner le générique de son dessin animé préféré et se mit à frotter les plats sales, s'assurant que chaque tâche était partie. Ce serait dommage si sa mère devait les laver une deuxième fois s'il ne faisait pas son travail proprement.

De l'autre côté du mur qui séparait la cuisine du salon, Jennie avait commencé par faire un peu d'ordre. Elle aimait prétendre qu'elle était en mission urgente et donc, elle régla un minuteur sur le téléphone de son père et hocha sa tête avant de commencer. Elle ramassa les objets qui étaient sur son chemin, comme la couverture qui était sur le fauteuil et la bouteille d'eau qui était sur la table basse, et les mit à part avant d'essuyer la poussière qui était sur les meubles.

\textit{-La voie est libre!} Annonça-t-elle au salon vide. \textit{Initialisation de la partie deux de la mission.} Dit-elle après avoir déterminé que rien ne serait sur son chemin. Puis, elle mit l'aspirateur en marche et commença par le tapis. À chaque fois qu'elle finissait de nettoyer une partie du salon, elle disait: \textit{La voie est sûre!}

Dans la salle de bain, Ophelia tria le linge sale et sépara les vêtements colorés des blancs. Elle aimait empiler les vêtements colorés dans l'ordre de leur apparition dans l'arc-en-ciel et elle empila les vêtements blancs en commençant par ceux les moins purs à ceux qui étaient aussi blancs que de la neige.

Elle remplit le bouchon de détergent et le mit dans le compartiment correspondant de la machine à laver après s'être assurée qu'elle avait bien mesuré. Cela lui donna l'impression d'être une chimiste, et elle commença à mettre les vêtements dans la machine. Elle appuya sur quelques boutons et le cycle de lavage se lança.

Le père de famille allait de chambre en chambre, nettoyant les fenêtres et les miroirs. La chambre de Marshall n'avait que le miroir qui était monté sur son armoire et une seule fenêtre, et donc il commença par elle, vu qu'elle était la plus facile à nettoyer. Et si quelqu'un lui avait demandé quelle pièce était la plus difficile, il aurait dit que c'était le salon avec ses fenêtres qui allaient du sol au plafond.

Il était impatient de voir ses enfants grandir pour qu'ils puissent l'aider à les nettoyer. Pour l'instant, c'était lui et sa femme qui s'en occupaient, vu que c'était trop dangereux pour les enfants de monter sur des chaises pour arriver aux parties les plus hautes et il se pourrait que l'un d'eux perde son équilibre et tombe.

Quand les vêtements avaient fini leur cycle de lavage et firent un tour dans le sèche-linge, Marshall avait fini de faire la vaisselle et les membres de la famille firent une rotation dans les chambres. Papa alla à la salle de bain pour nettoyer les cuvettes, Ophelia alla à la cuisine pour faire le parterre et Marshall alla dans sa chambre pour organiser son bureau et ranger ses jouets.

Jennie, d'autre part, était en train de passer l'aspirateur dans la chambre de ses parents. Tous les enfants avaient trouvé un moyen de s'amuser en faisant leurs tâches et l'idée de rendre leur mère fière et heureuse les poussa à travailler dur.

Quand tout le monde avait fini ses corvées, leur père les emmena déjeuner dehors. \textit{-C'est plus juste ainsi. Nous aussi on a le droit de manger dans un restaurant élégant, n'est-ce pas?} Il leur dit en rigolant. Ils savourèrent tous leurs plats et retournèrent chez eux. Comme chaque week-end, leur mère exprima sa joie et son appréciation de leur travail et leur considération avant de leur donner des cadeaux qu'elle leur avait ramenés de sa sortie. Certains étaient des pâtisseries, d'autres étaient des breloques mais tout le monde était d'accord que le meilleur cadeau était l'expression de fierté dans les yeux de leur mère quand elle vit la maison briller de propreté.

Die Hände des alten Mannes zitterten, seine Sicht war schwach und seine Beine dienten ihm nicht sehr gut.\\ 
\textit{A sluggish old man lived with his son, daughter in law, and four-year-old grandson. The old man's hands shivered, his vision was weak, and his legs did not serve him very well.}\\ 

Wenn die Familie sich zum Essen an den Tisch setzte, würden die zitternden Hände des Großvaters und die geringe Sehkraft das Essen sehr schwierig und unangenehm machen. \\

Wenn die Familie manchmal den Großvater ansah, sahen sie manchmal die Tränen in seinen Augen, wenn er allein da saß. \\

Dennoch, die einzigen Worte, die das junge Paar für ihn hatte, waren Worte der Wut, wenn etwas auf den Boden fiel. \\

Es war der erste große Streit seit vierzig Jahren, seit sie Seite an Seite lebten, Werkzeuge teilten und sich gegenseitig halfen. \\

Der Mann sagte: “Ich verstehe alles. Geben Sie mir Nagel und Bohrer und ich werde eien tolle Arbeit machen.” \\

Give me a reading comprehension exercise for a student learning French. It should have a subsection for answers.,"Marianne, assise sur la chaise de bureau de son grand frère, lui racontait avec enthousiasme qu'elle était élue par sa classe pour écrire un poème pour la compétition de son école. \\
Elle lui dit qu'elle voulait écrire quelque chose sur la nature et qu'elle voulait commencer immédiatement. \\
\textit{-Et bien, vas-y !} dit-il après avoir exprimé sa fierté d'elle. \textit{Je vais te prêter mon dictionnaire si tu veux !} Il l'encouragea. \\
Marianne rit avec amusement et lui dit qu'elle n'avait pas besoin d'un dictionnaire. \\
\textit{-Je n'ai pas été élue pour rien, voyons !} lui dit-elle. \textit{Je connais tous les mots, j'ai même gagné la compétition d'orthographe de mon école !} \\
Grand frère sourit et souleva un sourcil avec étonnement. \\
\textit{-Personne ne connaît tous les mots, Anne. Même les grands professeurs de littérature.} \\
\textit{-Et bien, tant pis pour eux ! Moi je sais que je les connais tous. Je comprends tous les mots dans mon livre de lecture et je n'ai jamais eu besoin d'un dictionnaire !} répondit la petite fille. \\
\textit{-Il est vrai que pour ton âge, tu as plus de connaissances que les autres en littérature, mais il y a sûrement quelques mots que tu ignores.} \\
\textit{-Non, aucun !} Grand frère adorait Marianne et ne voulait pas lui faire de peine, mais il ne voulait pas non plus qu'elle continue à penser qu'elle était arrivée au bout du chemin concernant son éducation. \\
Il était fier du fait qu'elle avait de la confiance en soi, mais il savait que ça pouvait très vite se transformer en arrogance et cela l'empêcherait d'apprendre davantage de choses à l'avenir. \\
Il était sûr qu'elle avait encore beaucoup à apprendre et il voulait l'aider. \\

Il passa quelques minutes à penser à une bonne méthode pour la corriger sans la vexer et finit par lui suggérer de lui apprendre des choses à lui. \\
\textit{-Contrairement à toi, je ne connais malheureusement pas tous les mots…} argumenta-t-il avec tristesse. \\
Marianne, qui aimait son grand frère et détestait le voir mécontent, accepta immédiatement de lui apprendre les mots qu'il ne connaissait pas. \\
\textit{-Peut-être que tu peux me donner des descriptions des choses dont tu ne connais pas le nom et je te dirai comment elles s'appellent.} \\
\textit{-C'est une très bonne idée !} dit-il avec joie. \textit{Tu sais quoi, il fait beau aujourd'hui. On devrait sortir dans le jardin, comme ça tu vas aussi être inspirée pour ton poème.} \\
Marianne accepta d'aller dehors et prit avec elle un petit carnet et un stylo, quant à son grand frère, il n'emporta que son téléphone portable avec lui. \\

Les deux s'installèrent sur le gazon et Marianne lui dit de commencer. \\
Grand frère, ne voulant pas la décourager, commença par quelque chose de plutôt facile. \\
\textit{-Tu sais ce qu'on appelle ça ?} dit-il en lui montrant les petites boules de tissu qui s'étaient formées sur son pull. \\
\textit{-Oh, ça, c'est de la bouloche !} répondit Marianne immédiatement. \\
\textit{-Je vois ! Et ces herbes que Maman utilise dans la cuisine ?} dit-il en pointant le doigt vers le petit jardin potager. \\
\textit{-Ce sont des aromates !} \\
\textit{-Tu peux me dire ce qu'on appelle une personne qui fait des acrobaties devant les gens dans la rue ?} \\
\textit{-Euh, un clown ? Un acrobate ?} \\
\textit{-Non, non, je crois qu'ils ont une autre appellation.} \\
\textit{-Je n'en connais pas d'autres,} répondit Marianne avec embarras. \\
\textit{-Ne t'inquiète pas, on va chercher sur internet.} Grand frère écrit quelques mots sur le clavier de son téléphone puis montra à Marianne le contenu de son écran. \\
\textit{-Ah, regarde là ! Ça s'appelle un saltimbanque.} \\
\textit{-Oh ! Bon, d'accord alors. Je ne connais pas un mot, ce n'est pas grave ! Vas-y ! Décris-moi autre chose !} dit-elle. \\
\textit{-Comment s'appelle le plat que Maman fait avec des haricots blancs et des saucissons ?} \\
\textit{-Le cassoulet !} \\
\textit{-Oh ! Et celui avec les choux fermentés ?} \\
\textit{-La choucroute !} Grand frère l'applaudit avec admiration. \\
\textit{-Tu peux me dire ce qu'on appelle l'élevage de lapins domestiques ?} \\
Marianne pensa un moment avant de dire qu'elle ne croyait pas qu'il y avait un mot pour ça, mais grand frère lui dit qu'il valait mieux vérifier quand même. \\
\textit{-Ah ! Là ! Cuniculture !} \\
\textit{-C'est mignon comme mot,} dit Marianne en rigolant. \\
\textit{-Bon, continuons,} dit grand frère. \textit{Comment s'appellent ces fleurs ?} dit-il en montrant de belles fleurs aux pétales roses. \\
\textit{-Des… euh, je ne sais pas,} répondit Marianne. \\

Il en prit une photo et lança une recherche basée sur images. \\
\textit{-Regarde, on dit ici que ça s'appelle des rhododendrons.} \\
\textit{-C'est un peu difficile à prononcer, hein ?} lui demanda-t-elle. \\
\textit{-Tout à fait. Reprenant, tu veux bien ?} \\
\textit{-Non… Tu sais… je ne suis plus aussi sûre que je connais tous les mots, après tout. J'en connais beaucoup, mais il y en a pas mal que je ne connais pas.} \\
\textit{-Ce n'est pas grave,} dit Grand Frère. \textit{Tu peux toujours les apprendre, tu es encore jeune. Peut-être que lorsque tu auras mon âge, tu vas les connaître tous !} \\
\textit{-Peut-être même avant !} dit Marianne avec enthousiasme. \\
\textit{-Oui ! Pourquoi pas !} \\

Ils gardèrent le silence pendant un moment puis Marianne leva timidement sa tête. \\
\textit{-Tu veux bien m'apprendre comment chercher des mots sur internet comme tu le fais ?} \\
\textit{-Bien sûr !} dit Grand Frère. \textit{Et je peux même te montrer comment le faire sur un dictionnaire, tu peux aussi t'en servir pour apprendre plus de mots.} \\
\textit{-D'accord ! Merci.} Grand Frère lui dit qu'ils feraient mieux de rentrer. \\

Give me a reading comprehension exercise for a student learning French. It should have a subsection for answers.,"En un jour chaud et ensoleillé, tandis que les criquets chantaient et que les fourmis montaient en queue sur un arbre, Jacob était à quatre pattes dans le petit jardin de sa maison et cherchait sans relâche dans l'herbe en quête du trèfle à quatre feuilles légendaire. \\
Le but principal de sa recherche était de s'attribuer la chance qui venait de l'objet, comme tout le monde. \\
Il ne croyait pas qu'il allait trouver facilement un fer à cheval dans la ville et il ne voulait certainement pas avoir la patte d'un lapin ! Quel genre de personne sans cœur pourrait faire ça à un pauvre lapin ?! \\
Et donc, sa seule option était un trèfle à quatre feuilles. S'il arrivait à l'avoir, il aurait de la chance et s'il avait de la chance, tout irait à merveille dans sa vie. \\

Le seul problème était que, malgré sa recherche méticuleuse, il n'arrivait pas à trouver l'objet en question. \\
Il commençait à se sentir frustré après une demi-heure de recherche et il considérait sérieusement d'abandonner sa tâche. \\
\textit{-Je commence à croire qu'ils n'ont jamais existé...} murmura-t-il de manière grincheuse en se tapotant les mains pour se débarrasser de la terre avec un souffle. \\

\textit{-Qu'est-ce qui te fait marmonner comme ça, petit ?} La voix de sa grande sœur survint de derrière lui, le faisant sursauter. \\
\textit{-Leah ! Ne viens pas derrière les gens ainsi !} la gronda-t-il en fronçant les sourcils. \\
\textit{-Pardon,} dit-elle en rigolant avant de s'asseoir sur l'herbe à côté de lui. \\
\textit{-Alors, pourquoi es-tu si contrarié ?} demanda-t-elle en lui pinçant la joue avant qu'il ne tape sa main. \\

Il laissa échapper un souffle avec un regard misérable et se massa la tempe pour se calmer. \\
\textit{-J'ai cherché partout à travers le jardin pour trouver un trèfle à quatre feuilles mais apparemment, tous les trèfles ici n'ont que trois feuilles.} \\

\textit{-Je vois,} Leah dit en mettant un bras sur ses genoux avant de mettre son menton dessus. \\
\textit{-Et pourquoi as-tu besoin d'en trouver un à quatre feuilles ?} \\

\textit{-Pour avoir de la chance, bien sûr. Pourquoi d'autre ?} dit-il en froissant son front. \\
\textit{-Et bien, pourquoi as-tu besoin d'avoir de la chance ?} \\
Est-ce qu'elle jouait l'idiote exprès ? Il savait à quel point elle était intelligente, alors elle était sûrement en train de le taquiner. \\
Jacob n'était pas d'humeur à se faire taquiner ! \\

\textit{-Et bien pour tout ! La chance nous aide avec tout, n'est-ce pas ? Ça rend tout plus facile et meilleur ! Je serai meilleur en football et j'aurai de meilleures notes et je gagnerai chaque partie de jeux vidéo que je jouerai !} expliqua-t-il en agitant ses mains un peu partout. \\

Sa grande sœur rigola et lui ébouriffa les cheveux. \\
\textit{-Calme-toi, mon grand. Je comprends.} \\
\textit{-Alors tu vois pourquoi j'ai besoin de le trouver.} \\

\textit{-Je ne crois pas que la chance marche autant que tu le penses, tu sais ?} Leah dit. \\
Jacob souffla et roula des yeux. \\
\textit{-Ouais, c'est ça. Elle ne savait rien... Les adultes ne savaient rien sur ses problèmes.} \\

\textit{-Non, je suis sérieuse. Est-ce que tu connais quelqu'un qui a réussi dans sa vie en comptant sur la chance ?} lui demanda-t-elle en arquant ses sourcils. \\
\textit{-Et bien... non, mais...} Il prit un moment pour penser à un argument mais ne pouvait pas en avoir un. \\

\textit{-Tu vois ? La majorité des gens qui ont accompli leurs buts comptent sur autre chose. Peux-tu deviner ce que c'est ?} demanda-t-elle avec un sourire taquin. \\
\textit{-Les miracles ?} Jacob répondit avec sarcasme, la faisant rire. \\
\textit{-Non, petit malin ! Le travail. Les gens travaillent dur pour réaliser leurs rêves. Ils s'améliorent dans leur métier en travaillant dur et en s'appliquant et ils amassent de l'expérience et du savoir qui les aideraient par la suite à travailler plus rapidement et de façon meilleure,} expliqua-t-elle. \\

\textit{-Ah, bon ? Donne-moi un exemple.} Le petit garçon la défia en croisant les bras. \\
\textit{-Toi ! Tu te rappelles à quel point tu étais faible en Histoire ?} Jacob fit une grimace en pensant à ses vieilles notes en Histoire. \\
Il détestait la matière et avait refusé de la réviser. \\

Mais, il était arrivé à s'y améliorer et il avait trouvé une manière de mémoriser ses leçons de manière efficace quand il s'était décidé à le faire et avec l'aide de Leah. \\
Maintenant, l'Histoire était devenue l'une de ses matières préférées et il n'avait que de bonnes notes. \\

\textit{-D'accord. Quoi d'autre ?} demanda-t-il, pas très convaincu. \\
Leah se tourna pour regarder la maison puis autour d'elle pour s'assurer que personne d'autre que Jacob ne pouvait l'entendre. \\
\textit{-Tu te souviens à quel point Maman était mauvaise en jardinage ?} \\

Jacob rigola en pensant à toutes les pauvres plantes que sa mère avait noyées en les arrosant plus qu'il ne fallait. \\
\textit{-Elle a fait beaucoup de progrès...} dit-il en regardant les rosiers qui étaient en pleine floraison grâce aux soins de sa mère. \\

\textit{-Et tout le monde sait que j'étais très mauvaise en basketball quand je venais tout juste de commencer. Maintenant, regarde-moi ! Après des mois et des mois de travail dur, je suis devenue capitaine de mon équipe à l'école !} Leah dit avec un sourire fier. \\

\textit{-C'est vrai. Papa n'arrête pas de parler de tes exploits,} Jacob dit avec un sourire taquin. \\
\textit{-Tu vois ? En réalité, tout le monde peut devenir excellent dans n'importe quel domaine. Tu es devenu meilleur en Histoire après avoir fait des efforts. Maman est devenue meilleure en jardinage parce qu'elle a refusé d'abandonner malgré toutes les plantes qu'elle avait tuées et moi, je suis devenue meilleure en basketball après des heures et des heures d'entraînement.} \\

\textit{Toute personne qui est bonne dans un domaine était mauvaise au début et s'est seulement améliorée après s'être exercée et avoir travaillé dur. La chance est une jolie chose mais si tout le monde comptait sur elle, on n'aurait pas de progrès dans tous les domaines.} \\

Jacob hocha la tête et sourit. \\
\textit{-Je comprends. Et puis qui a besoin de chance ? Je peux tout faire tout seul.} \\

\textit{-Et si tu as des soucis, tu peux toujours demander de l'aide,} Leah lui rappela avec un sourire. \\
Jacob sourit et la regarda d'un air penaud. \\
\textit{-Alors... tu veux bien m'aider pour trouver le trèfle à quatre feuilles...? Pas pour avoir de la chance ! Juste parce que je pense que ce serait cool d'en trouver un !} \\

Leah roula les yeux au ciel avec une expression affectueuse et lui sourit avant que les deux ne recommencent à chercher le fameux objet porteur de chance.

Give me a reading comprehension exercise for a student learning French. It should have a subsection for answers.,"Le soleil baignait le monde dans sa chaleur et sa lumière éclaircissait les fleurs en éclosion. \\
Ce beau matin, une petite fille regardait le joli jardin de sa grand-mère depuis le bord de la fenêtre de sa chambre, en tenant un verre de limonade dans sa main. \\
Elle soupira joyeusement après avoir pris une bonne bouffée d'air frais qui portait les douces odeurs des plantes puis, pencha sa tête sur la fenêtre, ayant la paisible sensation d'être chez elle. \\

Soudain, un petit mouvement irrégulier saisit son attention et elle concentra son regard sur la source de ce mouvement qui était une toute petite araignée suspendue au bout d'un fil qui était emporté par la brise. \\
Felicity rigola sur la scène bizarre qui lui rappela, en fait, un film qu'elle avait regardé il n'y avait pas très longtemps avec ses grands-parents. \\

\textit{-Cette araignée paraît exactement comme les cambrioleurs qui étaient descendus du plafond pour voler le joyau du musée royal,} pensa-t-elle en regardant le petit insecte s'éloigner d'elle, flottant vers l'inconnu. \\

Elle tourna son regard vers la plante empotée qui était juste sous la fenêtre et regarda une abeille qui avait la tête dans une fleur et elle laissa échapper un rire. \\
\textit{-Quelle petite créature loufoque !} dit-elle en regardant le petit insecte volant se tortiller pour aller plus profondément dans la fleur. \\

Les abeilles travaillaient tellement dur ! La petite fille soupira et pensa que la vie devait être très intéressante pour les insectes. \\
Elle se demanda ce que ça ferait de voir les choses de leur perspective. \\

Tout devait paraître gigantesque et les petits brins d'herbe qu'elle voyait devaient être une jungle pour les minuscules insectes qui résidaient dans le jardin de sa grand-mère. \\

\textit{-Si seulement je pouvais rétrécir pour un jour...} pensa-t-elle en baillant avec paresse juste avant de s'endormir contre la fenêtre. \\

Quand elle se leva, elle était toujours sur le bord de la fenêtre dans la maison de sa grand-mère mais elle était devenue beaucoup plus petite. \\

\textit{-Fais attention à ce que tu souhaites, hein...?} elle murmura à elle-même en regardant autour d'elle avec fascination. \\
Elle ne sentit aucun regret, par contre. Elle était excitée de vivre ce nouveau changement et était impatiente de voir comment sa journée allait se dérouler. \\

Elle passa un peu de temps à observer son entourage. \\
Tout paraissait différent. Le verre de limonade - qui était à présent tiède - dont elle buvait auparavant lui sembla être aussi haut qu'une tour et le bord de la fenêtre paraissait aussi vaste qu'une autoroute. \\

Les rayons de soleil qui perçaient la vitre étaient éblouissants et dégageaient de la chaleur et elle fit en sorte de se mettre dans les endroits les moins intenses. \\
Ce qu'elle crut être une légère brise avant se transforma en un vent soufflant qui lui ébouriffa les cheveux. \\

Quand elle se tourna pour regarder sa chambre, elle ne put pas voir grand-chose au-delà de son vaste lit. \\
L'ours en peluche qui y était se tenait comme une statue immense et elle abandonna l'idée d'explorer la chambre le moment où elle l'eut en tête. \\

Elle voulait voir à quoi le monde extérieur ressemblait et elle n'était pas sûre qu'elle allait pouvoir regrimper sur le bord de la fenêtre plus tard si elle en descendait maintenant. \\
Et donc, en se tournant vers la fenêtre, elle la regarda pour voir si elle pourrait trouver le chemin le plus facile pour descendre au jardin et sa recherche fut fructueuse en peu de temps. \\

Elle marcha vers l'extrémité gauche de la fenêtre et testa les petites branches de la plante qui avaient grimpé le long des murs de la maison de ses grands-parents et quand elle était sûre qu'elles étaient assez robustes, elle les utilisa pour descendre. \\

L'odeur de l'herbe fraîchement tondue la frappa et elle marcha à travers le gazon en écartant les brins d'herbe de son chemin avec ses mains. \\
Elle regarda à sa droite et vit des fourmis marcher en file à un rythme rapide. \\
La plupart des fourmis portaient une sorte de graines qui étaient deux fois plus grandes qu'elles et elle les regarda passer avec admiration. \\

Une fois la parade de fourmis passée, elle reprit son chemin et l'insecte suivant qu'elle vit fut un mille-pattes. \\
Elle laissa échapper un souffle effrayé car l'insecte lui parut beaucoup plus intimidant quand elle était aussi petite et elle décida de ne pas bouger et de garder le silence, faisant semblant de ne pas exister jusqu'à ce que la voie devienne libre. \\

Quand l'insecte ayant plus de pattes qu'elle ne put compter passa, elle reprit son chemin autour du jardin. \\
\textit{-Wow...} murmura-t-elle, impressionnée en voyant une libellule juste avant qu'elle ne s'envole. \\
Elle était magnifique et elle se sentit chanceuse d'avoir pu la voir de si près. \\

En allant plus loin à travers le jardin, elle rencontra aussi une créature moins jolie. \\
Elle fit la grimace en dégoût alors qu'une limace passa devant elle, laissant une traînée de bave qu'elle devait croiser pour continuer en avant. \\

\textit{-Il n'y a rien à faire...} dit-elle à elle-même en mettant un pied au-delà du chemin de bave après l'autre. \\

Mais, tandis qu'elle était occupée à croiser sans mettre les pieds sur la substance dégoûtante, elle ne vit pas la mante religieuse géante qui la guettait et lorsqu'elle se tourna, elle la vit sauter sur elle. \\

Avant qu'elle n'eût le temps de crier, elle se trouva en l'air et quand elle regarda en haut, elle ne put voir que les grandes ailes colorées d'un papillon. \\
L'insecte la déposa sur le bord de la fenêtre et inclina la tête avant de s'envoler. \\

\textit{-Merci de m'avoir sauvé !} Felicity cria en agitant la main en l'air. \\
\textit{Je crois que cela me fait assez d'excitation pour aujourd'hui...} se dit-elle en glissant sur le rideau et avant de grimper sur ses draps. \\

Elle se mit sur son lit à côté de l'ours en peluche géant et décida de prendre une sieste après sa marche fatigante à travers le jardin géant. \\
Elle ferma les yeux et elle sut que lorsqu'elle les ouvrirait la prochaine fois, elle aurait regagné sa taille normale.

Give me a combination of a word problem and a problem-solving exercise for a 5th grade student learning mathematics. It should have a subsection for answers.,"India has a bowl of fruit. \( \frac{1}{4} \) are apples, \( \frac{1}{3} \) are papayas, \( \frac{1}{6} \) are mangos, and the other fruit are bananas. Calculate the possible numbers of each fruit. Your answer should use a common denominator.

\subsection*{Answers}
Let the total number of fruits be \( x \). Then:
\begin{itemize}
\item Number of apples = \( \frac{1}{4}x \)
\item Number of papayas = \( \frac{1}{3}x \)
\item Number of mangos = \( \frac{1}{6}x \)
\item Number of bananas = \( x - \left(\frac{1}{4}x + \frac{1}{3}x + \frac{1}{6}x\right) \)
\end{itemize}

To find a common denominator, we can use 12:
\begin{itemize}
\item Number of apples = \( \frac{3}{12}x \)
\item Number of papayas = \( \frac{4}{12}x \)
\item Number of mangos = \( \frac{2}{12}x \)
\end{itemize}

Adding these fractions gives:
\[
\frac{3}{12}x + \frac{4}{12}x + \frac{2}{12}x = \frac{9}{12}x
\]
Thus, the number of bananas is:
\[
x - \frac{9}{12}x = \frac{3}{12}x = \frac{1}{4}x
\]

The total number of fruits must be a multiple of the least common multiple of the denominators (4, 3, and 6), which is 12. Therefore, possible values for \( x \) could be 12, 24, 36, etc."

El vestido que ella quiere viene en varios colores. ¿Cuál color le quedará mejor? Para saber qué color le queda mejor, ella se prueba todos los vestidos que hay disponibles. Fabiana y Ariana se quedan sentadas esperándola afuera de los probadores. Ellas no pueden creer cuánto tiempo le toma a Rocío decidirse por un color de vestido. Al final, ella no sabe qué color escoger y le pregunta a sus amigas. ¿Qué es lo que ellas dicen? Ellas le dicen que ella debe comprar el vestido de color azul. A ella le encanta la idea y se lo compra. Ahora sólo falta pagar por el vestido. Felizmente, Rocío tiene su tarjeta de crédito. Si ella usa su tarjeta de crédito, ella tendrá incluso más descuentos disponibles. Ariana quiere comprar un cargador de celular. ¿Dónde puede conseguir un cargador de celular? En la tienda de electrónicos, ¡por supuesto! Como Fabiana también quiere comprar unos nuevos audífonos, ella decide ir con ella. ¿Qué hay de Rocío? Ella no quiere ir porque piensa que ir a la tienda de electrónicos es muy aburrido. Por ello, Rocío se queda tomando un café cerca de la tienda de ropa. Ariana encuentra el cargador que quiere, pero desafortunadamente, ese cargador no tiene ningún descuento. Lo bueno es que ella al menos no necesitará gastar mucho dinero ya que ese cargador no está tan caro. Fabiana, por su parte, va a buscar los audífonos que ella quiere comprar. Ella vio los audífonos que quiere comprar en televisión. Son muy caros pero ella piensa que ahora de seguro el precio habrá bajado debido a los descuentos. Fabiana estaba en lo cierto. ¡Los audífonos que ella quiere comprar no cuestan casi nada! Fabiana no lo piensa mucho y los compra de inmediato. La única persona que no compra nada es Ariana. A pesar de que el cargador de celular que ella encontró es barato, ella no lo quiere comprar porque no tiene suficiente dinero. Lo bueno de tener amigas es que, a veces, ellas te ayudan si tú necesitas algo. En este caso, Ariana necesitaba dinero para comprar el cargador y sus amigas quieren ayudarla a comprárselo. Fabiana y Rocío dan a Ariana el dinero que necesita para comprar el cargador y ella les agradece. Al final, todos salen del centro comercial muy contentos.

I would choose: message (Mensaje); list (Lista); instructions (Instrucciones); water (Agua); color (Color); book (Libro); toy (Juguete); mommy (Mami); coffee (Café); room (Habitación).

Give me a reading comprehension exercise for a student learning French. It should have a subsection for answers.,"C'était calme et silencieux chez les Walter, mis à part les sons de claquement de fourchettes contre les plats. \\
Toute la famille était réunie pour savourer leur déjeuner ensemble et bien qu'ils parlèrent à certains moments, ils étaient principalement concentrés sur leurs assiettes. \\

Jayden, le membre le plus jeune de la famille, prit un morceau de carotte avec sa fourchette et le regarda curieusement. \\
Ça n'avait pas un mauvais goût et il n'avait jamais eu de problèmes pour manger ses légumes mais il ne les trouvait pas aussi bons que du chocolat ou des bonbons. \\

\textit{-Est-ce qu'il y a un problème avec ta nourriture, mon grand ?} demanda son père qui avait préparé le déjeuner ce jour-là en le voyant regarder le morceau de carotte. \\
\textit{-Non. Tout est bon,} Jayden dit en mettant le morceau de légume dans sa bouche. \\

\textit{-Pourquoi regardais-tu tes carottes comme ça, alors ?} demanda sa mère. \\
Le petit garçon haussa ses épaules avec nonchalance. \\
\textit{-C'est juste que je ne comprends pas.} Sa réponse vague n'éclaircit rien pour ses parents et son père lui demanda ce qu'il ne comprenait pas exactement. \\

Jayden finit de mâcher sa nourriture avant de répondre. \\
\textit{-Eh bien, pourquoi devons-nous manger des légumes et de la viande et des pâtes et tout quand on peut manger des trucs bons au lieu de ça ?} \\

\textit{-Tu ne trouves pas que les pâtes sont bonnes ? J'ai cru que tu aimais les spaghetti aux boulettes de viande,} son père lui dit. \\
\textit{Tu avais dit que c'était bon la dernière fois que nous en avons mangé.} \\
\textit{-Ouais, ce n'est pas mal, je crois...} Il soupira avant de prendre un peu de brocoli de son assiette et de le manger. \\

Ses parents se regardèrent avant que sa mère ne lui demande ce qu'il voulait dire par des trucs bons. \\
\textit{-Eh bien, tu sais...} Il posa sa fourchette et regarda ses parents. \\
\textit{Des barres de chocolat et des sucettes et des bonbons. Des trucs bons comme ça. Pourquoi ne pouvons-nous pas en manger à chaque repas ? On n'en mange qu'en tant que gâteries et lors des fêtes.} \\

\textit{-Eh bien, c'est parce qu'ils ne sont pas très nutritifs,} son père lui dit. \\

Jayden ne savait pas ce que “nutritifs” voulait dire et fixa son père du regard. \\
Celui-ci reçut le message et commença à expliquer en termes plus simples. \\
\textit{-Tu n'auras pas de vitamines ni de protéines en mangeant des bonbons. Ce n'est en réalité que du sucre... et il y a aussi du gras dans le chocolat et quelques autres sortes de bonbons.} \\

\textit{-Je croyais que le sucre nous donne de l'énergie,} Jayden dit en retour. \\
\textit{-Eh bien, c'est vrai, mais seulement en petites quantités.} \\

\textit{Et il y a aussi quelques types de sucre plus complexes qui nous donnent de l'énergie de façon meilleure et tu peux en trouver dans les pommes de terre et les pâtes.} \\

La maman de Jayden lui expliqua en montrant son assiette du doigt. \\
Il regarda la part de purée de pommes de terre qui était dans son assiette et en prit une bouchée avant de retourner son attention vers ses parents. \\

\textit{-Haylee prend ces pilules qui contiennent des vitamines à l'intérieur,} dit-il en pointant sa fourchette sur sa grande sœur. \\
\textit{Pourquoi on n'en prend pas à la place des légumes ? Comme ça on aura des vitamines et on gardera de la place dans nos ventres pour les bonbons ?} \\

\textit{-Eh bien, ces pilules s'appellent des suppléments et elles ne sont utilisées que pour t'aider.} \\
\textit{Haylee mange quand même tous ses légumes et sa nourriture, n'est-ce pas ?} sa mère répondit. \\

\textit{-Oui, je suppose...} \\

\textit{-Et les suppléments ne contiennent pas beaucoup de fibres. Les fibres sont très importantes parce qu'elles aident ton ventre à digérer ta nourriture.} \\
\textit{Si tu ne manges pas assez de fibres, tu peux avoir des maux d'estomac,} son père ajouta. \\

\textit{-Et même quand tu manges ta nourriture, tu peux quand même avoir mal au ventre en mangeant trop de bonbons et de sucreries.} \\
\textit{Tu te rappelles de la fois où tu avais mangé la moitié du gâteau d'anniversaire de Grand-mère ?} sa mère demanda en arquant son sourcil. \\

Jayden fit une grimace en se rappelant du souvenir. \\
Non seulement il avait eu terriblement mal au ventre, mais il avait dû boire un horrible sirop amer pour se remettre de son malaise. \\
\textit{Beurk ! Oui. Je m'en rappelle.} \\

\textit{-Et les bonbons te font grossir !} sa grande sœur lui dit. \\

C'était la première fois qu'elle avait parlé depuis le début de la conversation. \\
Jayden fronça ses sourcils et la regarda curieusement. \\
Comment était-il possible pour un tout petit morceau de caramel de faire grossir qui que ce soit ? \\

Il regarda son assiette qui était encore à moitié pleine. \\
Si quelque chose avait le potentiel de faire grossir les gens, ça devrait être les immenses quantités de nourriture qu'ils mangeaient à chaque repas. \\

\textit{-Je crois que les pâtes et la purée de pommes de terre peuvent te rendre encore plus gros que les bonbons...} répondit-il. \\

\textit{-Tu as besoin de glucides et tu peux en avoir en mangeant des pâtes, des pommes de terre et du pain ainsi que des aliments semblables et ton corps prend un peu de temps pour les transformer en sucre,} \\
\textit{et donc tu ne grossis pas en les mangeant sauf si tu en manges plus que tu n'es censé.} \\

\textit{Les légumes ne contiennent pas beaucoup de sucre, et la viande n'en contient pas du tout.} \\
\textit{Mais les bonbons sont purement faits en sucre et à part si tu es en train de faire des activités qui brûlent ce sucre rapidement, ton corps va le garder sous forme de gras.} \\

\textit{En y pensant, manger équilibré t'aide à rester en forme parce que tu remplis ton ventre avec des choses qui sont bonnes pour ton corps et tu te sens rassasié et du coup tu ne grignotes pas en mangeant des bonbons.} \\

Dit-elle en lui pinçant la joue joyeusement. \\
\textit{-Je comprends que les pâtes et les pommes de terre me donnent de l'énergie et que les légumes gardent mon ventre en bonne santé, mais quel est l'intérêt de la viande ?} le petit garçon demanda, sur un ton qui défia ses parents. \\

Bon, il avoua que la viande avait un bon goût en quelque sorte, mais ce n'était pas mieux que les bonbons. \\

\textit{-La viande t'aide à grandir. Les gens ayant des muscles impressionnants mangent beaucoup de viande, des poissons et des œufs pour avoir des protéines.} \\
\textit{Tout comme le lait aide tes os à devenir plus forts, la viande aide tes muscles aussi,} son père répondit en pliant son bras pour montrer son biceps à Jayden. \\

Bon, Jay devait admettre que l'idée d'avoir des muscles comme ceux de son père était vraiment cool et il voulait grandir et devenir fort comme lui. \\
Il regarda son assiette, prit sa fourchette et recommença à manger. \\

Une fois qu'il eut fini son assiette, il regarda son père et demanda : \\
\textit{-Alors, on mange quoi pour le dessert ?} \\

Tous les membres de la famille qui étaient à table secouèrent leur tête affectueusement. \\
\textit{-Une salade de fruits,} son père lui dit et l'expression déçue de Jayden fit rire tout le monde.

Give me a reading comprehension exercise for a student learning French. It should have a subsection for answers.,"Un beau jour, dans une cabane perchée dans un arbre, un groupe d'enfants était rassemblé pour passer la journée ensemble. Amis depuis leur plus jeune âge, ils allaient tous à la même école et passaient leur temps libre les uns avec les autres. Ce jour-là, ils étaient chez Hervé. Celui-ci, allongé sur le dos, un bras sous la tête, semblait pensif. Un moment plus tard, il se redressa pour prendre une position assise et dit à ses amis :\\

-- Vous vous rappelez de la fête d'anniversaire d'Aurélie ?\\

-- Je ne pense pas qu'on soit prêts de l'oublier de sitôt, répondit Capucine en posant son livre d'histoire avant de se tourner vers lui.\\

-- C'était la fête la plus amusante de ma vie ! remarqua Aude avec un sourire.\\

-- Oui ! s'écria Marcel. Il y avait tellement de jeux ! On pouvait jouer sur le trampoline et même aller dans la piscine !\\

-- Et il y avait tant de bonnes choses à manger ! ajouta Cyril avec un sourire rêveur.\\

-- Tu parles de la pinata ou des coupes de glace ? lui demanda Aude avec un sourire taquin.\\

-- Je pense qu'on est tous d'accord que la pizza géante était la star du buffet, dit Hervé.\\

-- Mais j'y pense, comment fait-on une pizza aussi grande ?\\

Les autres enfants prirent un moment pour réfléchir à la question de Capucine, mais Aude fut la première à répondre en disant que son père lui avait expliqué que les choses géantes étaient faites avec des pièces assemblées dans une usine.\\

-- Je suppose que c'est logique, vu que la pizza avait quatre parties avec des garnitures différentes, dit Marcel en hochant la tête. Ma partie préférée était celle avec la garniture poulet-champignons, miam ! Vous imaginez si on essayait d'en faire une nous-mêmes ? demanda Cyril avec enthousiasme.\\

À ces mots, les quatre autres commencèrent à rêvasser. Ils furent transportés de leur petite cabane en bois à une grande usine sophistiquée, pleine de machines et de matériaux.\\

-- On va commencer par diviser les tâches, dit Hervé. Capucine et Cyril feront la pâte, Aude et Marcel prépareront la sauce, et moi, je râperai le fromage. Quand on aura fini, on laissera lever les quartiers de pâte, puis on fera cuire les différentes garnitures, assemblera la pizza, mettra la sauce, la garniture et le fromage, et cuira chaque partie dans un four différent. Une fois toutes les parties prêtes, on assemble le tout !\\

Les autres acceptèrent le plan d'Hervé, sauf Cyril, qui leva la main et dit :\\

-- Je voudrais râper le fromage à ta place, et toi, tu peux faire la pâte avec Capucine.\\

-- Pas question ! dit Aude. Tu mangerais la moitié du fromage si on te laissait faire.\\

Hervé, Capucine et Marcel rirent tandis que Cyril boudait en murmurant que ce n'était pas juste. Les cinq mirent des tabliers, des gants et des coiffes de cuisinier, puis se dispersèrent chacun dans leur coin.\\

Capucine demanda à Cyril de lui chercher la farine et la levure pendant qu'elle chauffait un peu d'eau. Elle versa la levure dans l'eau tiède avec un peu de sucre tandis que Cyril lui ramena l'huile et le sel.\\

-- Hé, Capucine, regarde ! dit Cyril avant de lui mettre de la farine sur le nez lorsqu'elle releva la tête pour le regarder.\\

-- Hé !!!\\

Elle lui rendit la pareille, et les deux éclatèrent de rire avant de se remettre au travail. Ils mirent les ingrédients dans le pétrin, puis posèrent le bol près du four préchauffé.\\

Pendant ce temps, Aude et Marcel préparaient la sauce.\\

-- Pourquoi on doit y mettre du sucre ? demanda Marcel.\\

-- Pour neutraliser l'acidité de la tomate, répondit la fillette.\\

-- Est-ce qu'on a vraiment besoin de toutes ces épices ?\\

-- Oui, c'est ce qui donne un bon goût à la sauce.\\

-- On peut se passer de l'ail, tu ne crois pas ? dit Marcel avec un air incertain.\\

Aude le regarda, puis regarda la grande marmite contenant la sauce.\\

-- Tu n'aimes pas l'ail ?\\

-- Non, je trouve ça un peu fort.\\

Ils échangèrent un regard complice, et Aude haussa les épaules avant de poser l'ail sur la table.\\

-- Ça ne fera de mal à personne s'il manque un ingrédient, hein ? dit-elle avec un sourire.\\

-- Personne n'a besoin de savoir qu'il manque un ingrédient d'ailleurs, répondit Marcel.\\

Ils se serrèrent la main puis continuèrent leur travail : Aude ajoutait les ingrédients tandis que Marcel remuait la sauce sur le feu.\\

De l'autre côté de l'usine, Hervé râpait le fromage et, un peu comme Cyril l'aurait fait, prit soin de le goûter.\\

-- Juste pour vérifier si c'est de la bonne qualité… se dit-il.\\

Lorsque toutes les tâches principales furent accomplies, le groupe d'enfants passa à la cuisson des garnitures. Cyril insista pour une partie poulet-champignons, Aude et Capucine voulaient des poivrons et du pepperoni, Hervé opta pour une garniture italienne avec basilic, olives et mozzarella, et Marcel surprit tout le monde en choisissant de mettre de l'ananas dans une partie.\\

-- À chacun sa tasse ! dit-il.\\

Ils firent cuire le tout avant de mettre la sauce, la garniture et le fromage sur les quartiers de pâte, puis transférèrent les morceaux au four sur un grand chariot. Lorsqu'une délicieuse odeur emplit l'usine, indiquant que les parties de pizza étaient prêtes, ils les sortirent prudemment, les mirent un à un sur un grand plan de travail, puis les poussèrent côte à côte pour former un grand disque de pizza.\\

Ils se regardèrent, fatigués, souriants, et surtout fiers de leur travail.\\

-- Qui a faim ?\\

Une voix mélodieuse interrompit le rêve éveillé des cinq enfants. Hervé se tourna vers sa mère, perchée sur l'escalier de la cabane.\\

-- Ça vous dit d'aller manger au resto rapide ? leur demanda-t-elle.\\

Les cinq amis acceptèrent l'offre avec enthousiasme et lui dirent qu'ils savaient déjà ce qu'ils voulaient : une pizza !\\

Give me a reading comprehension exercise for a student learning French. It should have a subsection for answers.,"Cindy était assise sur les marches qui étaient à l'entrée de sa maison, elle avait la tête inclinée sur sa main et ses sourcils étaient froncés. \\
Elle scrutait l'herbe du jardin de sa maison comme si celui-ci était la source de tous ses malheurs. \\
Elle était très irritée et ceci était clair à toute personne qui l'aurait vue à ce moment-là. Ou plutôt, qui aurait vu ses expressions. \\

La raison pour laquelle Cindy faisait la tête était assez simple : elle était frustrée car elle avait eu une très bonne idée — ou, du moins, elle avait cru que c'était le cas — qui avait mal tourné quand elle avait essayé de l'exécuter. \\
Son idée n'était pas quelque chose de vraiment compliqué. C'était même une idée très simple. \\
Elle avait pensé que si elle nouait ses lacets et courait à travers son jardin, elle pourrait s'entraîner seule pour la course à trois jambes de son école. \\
Malheureusement, son idée échoua et quand elle tenta de prendre le premier pas, elle finit par tomber. \\
Ses coudes étaient égratignés et sa fierté était touchée par l'échec de l'idée qu'elle avait cru être brillante. \\
Quelle honte ! \\

\textit{-Ça aurait été super si les idées pouvaient nous prévenir d'avance et nous dire si elles sont de bonnes ou de mauvaises idées...} murmura-t-elle à elle-même avec un soupir malheureux. \\
Selon elle, cela l'aurait épargnée. Ou du moins, ses coudes auraient été épargnés. \\

Elle commença à rêvasser en pensant à cette idée. \\
\textit{-Si ma mauvaise idée était devenue une personne pour me prévenir en avance, elle aurait eu une apparence affreuse...} dit-elle en imaginant une petite version d'elle-même habillée en pyjama sale. \\
La ""mauvaise"" idée avait les cheveux en l'air et du sable dans les yeux, n'ayant clairement pas fait sa toilette du matin. \\

\textit{-Je parie que tu ne t'es même pas brossée les dents...} Cindy lui dit. \\
\textit{-Pourquoi faire ? Je ne vais rien accomplir de toute façon.} La petite idée-Cindy répondit en baillant. \\
\textit{-Beurk ! J'avais raison, tu as une haleine de chacal !} Cindy l'accusa en agitant sa main devant son nez. \\

L'idée sourit et agita la main avec audace avant de disparaître. \\
\textit{-Ce n'est pas étonnant qu'elle ait échoué,} pensa-t-elle. \textit{J'aurais pu deviner si j'avais vu à quoi elle ressemblait...} \\

Avec un soupir, elle décida de se dégourdir les jambes et se leva pour le faire. \\
En descendant les marches, elle pensa à la première personne qui avait pensé à les construire. \\
Elle ne connaissait pas qui avait inventé les marches et donc elle imagina que c'était elle, et une petite vision d'elle apparut devant elle. \\

\textit{-Salut, petite moi !} salua-t-elle. \\
La petite idée avait une belle apparence. Elle était habillée convenablement mais ses vêtements n'étaient pas très sophistiqués, c'était seulement une salopette en jean avec un T-shirt en coton en dessous. \\
Elle était propre et ses cheveux étaient brossés et tenus en queue de cheval. \\
Elle sourit timidement et fit un signe de la main en guise de salut. \\

\textit{-La conception des marches était une idée simple mais très bonne. Cela a permis aux gens de monter à de hauts endroits après qu'ils avaient eu des difficultés avec les pentes raides,} l'idée l'informa avec un sourire confiant. \\
Cindy hocha la tête. \\
\textit{-C'était sûrement une bonne idée vu qu'on l'utilise jusqu'à ce jour.} \\

Une autre idée apparut devant elle et s'éclaircit la gorge. \\
\textit{-L'ascenseur était une idée encore meilleure,} dit-elle avec une expression hautaine. \\
Celle-ci était habillée en costume parfaitement repassé et portait des lunettes. \\
Ses cheveux étaient coiffés en un chignon qui rappela à Cindy la directrice de son école. \\
\textit{-Très pratique pour les gens avec des handicaps et permet de gagner du temps. D'ailleurs, les gens n'ont qu'à appuyer sur quelques boutons,} l'idée ajouta. \\

Avant que Cindy n'eût le temps de répondre, l'idée-escalier prit la parole. \\
\textit{-Oui, m-mais inutile sans électricité,} elle argumenta en levant son index. \\
L'idée-ascenseur laissa échapper un souffle et parut très offensée. \\
\textit{-De nos jours, les coupures de courant sont très rares,} répondit-elle en croisant les bras. \\

\textit{-Pas aussi rares que ça dans certains pays. Je suis sûre qu'ils sont contents d'avoir des escaliers.} Telle était la réponse de l'idée-escalier. \\
Cindy rigola en regardant les deux idées se chamailler sur laquelle d'entre elles était la plus révolutionnaire jusqu'à ce que les deux disparurent avec un son de ""pouf"" en laissant un nuage de poussière colorée derrière elles. \\

Elle continua à marcher sans destination en tête à travers le jardin et s'arrêta quand elle vit un nain de jardin. \\
Cindy inclina la tête sur le côté et le regarda avec confusion. \\
C'était l'une des idées dont elle ne pouvait pas se résigner. À quoi pensait la personne qui les avait inventés ? \\

Soudain, une autre idée apparut devant elle. Celle-là portait une jupe, un tricot en laine et une paire de mocassins. \\
Ses cheveux étaient en cascade et elle regarda autour d'elle, distraite par son entourage. \\
\textit{-Salut...?} Cindy la salua avec hésitation. \\
\textit{-Es-tu censée être une bonne ou mauvaise idée ?} \\

L'idée haussa ses épaules et sourit. \\
\textit{-Je suis l'idée-naine-de-jardin. Je n'étais qu'une pensée impulsive, rien de trop sophistiqué.} \\
\textit{-Eh bien, comment celui qui t'a inventée a su que tu allais devenir populaire ?} Cindy demanda. \\

L'idée sourit et secoua la tête. \\
\textit{-Il ne le savait pas. Il m'a juste appliquée en espérant avoir un bon résultat. Certaines choses dans la vie marchent ainsi, le sais-tu ? Tu dois tenter ta chance et voir ce qui va se passer !} \\

Cindy regarda l'idée en face. Elle n'y avait pas pensé ainsi. \\
Elle pensa que cette approche allait lui éviter des déceptions. \\
Si quelqu'un essaie quelque chose sans penser à sa réussite ou son échec, il ne serait pas déçu en cas d'échec. \\
D'autre part, si l'idée réussit, il aurait une bonne surprise. \\

\textit{-Eh bien, je dois y aller ! À plus tard !} l'idée-naine-de-jardin dit avant de disparaître. \\
Cindy scruta l'endroit où l'idée était avant qu'un sourire n'apparût lentement sur son visage. \\
\textit{-Je crois qu'il est temps de réfléchir à quelques idées...} se dit-elle en courant à sa chambre pour commencer à planifier sa prochaine idée.

Give me a combination of a reading exercise and a comprehension exercise for a student learning German. It should have a subsection for answers.,"Ein erfolgreicher Geschäftsmann wurde älter und erkannte, dass jemand ihn ersetzen sollte. Anstatt einige seiner Kollegen oder jemanden aus seiner Familie auszuwählen, entschied er sich, etwas Ungewöhnliches zu tun. Er lud alle potenziellen Kandidaten, Finanzdirektoren, Abteilungsleiter, Kassierer, Berater, ein und gab ihnen die folgende Rede:\\
\textit{One successful businessman was getting older and realized that someone should replace him. Instead of choosing some of his colleagues or someone from his family, he decided to do something unusual. He invited all potential candidates, financial directors, chiefs of departments, cashiers, and advisors and gave them the following speech:}\\

""Liebe Freunde, es ist Zeit für mich, mein Geschäft zu beenden und in einen verdienten Ruhestand zu gehen. Außerdem ist es jetzt die beste Zeit, einen neuen Geschäftsführer auszuwählen, der unser Unternehmen in Zukunft leiten wird ... Ich habe mich entschieden, dass es einer von euch sein wird. ""\\
\textit{""Dear friends, it's time for me to finish my business and go to a deserved retirement. Also, now is the best time to choose a new general manager who will lead our company in the future. I decided that it would be one of you.""}\\

Die jungen potenziellen Chefs waren verwirrt ...\\
\textit{The young prospective bosses were confused ...}\\

""Ich werde jedem von euch einen Samen geben. Dies ist ein ganz besonderer Samen. Ich will, dass ihr ihn alle pflanzt und gießt, und nächstes Jahr wieder zurückbringt, um zu sehen, was ihr damit gemacht habt. Dann werde ich entscheiden, wer der neue Geschäftsführer sein wird. ""\\
\textit{""I will give each of you one seed. This is a very special seed. I want all of you to plant it and water it and we will gather again next year to see what you did with it. Then I will decide who will be the new manager. ""}\\

Jim war auch bei diesem Treffen dabei, und wie auch alle anderen die anwesend waren, bekam er einen Samen. Als er nach Hause kam, teilte er die Nachricht mit seiner Frau und sie beschlossen, den Samen zu nähren, aus dem die Pflanze wachsen würde. Sie fanden einen schönen Topf, legten den Dünger und einen Thermometer ein, haben ein paar Bücher über Pflanzenanbau gelesen und fuhren mit ihrem Leben fort. Jeden Tag gingen sie zu dem Topf und warteten gespannt darauf, dass etwas auftaucht.\\
\textit{Jim was also at this meeting, and as everyone else present, he got the seed, too. When he arrived home, he shared the message with his wife and they decided to nurture the seed from which the plant would grow. They found a nice pot, put the fertilizer, took a thermometer, read a few books on plant cultivation, and continued with their lives. Every day they went to the pot and eagerly waited for something to emerge.}\\ 

Nach 14 Tagen haben einige von Jims Kollegen bereits angefangen, über ihre wachsenden Pflanzen zu sprechen. Und Jim beobachtete den Topf jeden Tag mit seiner Frau, aber nichts passierte. Es ist über ein Monat vergangen und nichts ist passiert. Über die Pflanzen wurde schon viel diskutiert.\\ 
\textit{After 14 days, some of Jim's colleagues had already started talking about their growing plants. And Jim watched with his wife every day, but nothing happened. It had been over a month and nothing happened. There had already been a lot of discussion about the plants.}\\ 

Zur Mittagszeit tauschten sie praktische Ideen über schnellen Wachstum aus, und Jim erkannte, dass er als einziger keinen Erfolg hatte.\\ 
\textit{At lunch-time, they exchanged practical ideas of rapid growth, and Jim realized that he was alone with nothing and that he was unsuccessful.}\\ 

Sechs Monate später, und es gab immer noch keine Fortschritte. Er begann zu glauben, dass er einen Fehler gemacht hatte. Vielleicht zu viel Wasser oder schlechter Dünger oder etwas anderes, das er nicht erklären konnte. Er wusste, dass er sein Bestes gab und es tat ihm leid, dass er keine Ergebnisse hatte.\\ 
\textit{Six months later, and there was still no progress. He began to believe that he had made a mistake. Maybe too much water or bad fertilizer or something else that he could not explain. He knew he did the best he could and was sorry he had no results.}\\ 

Das Jahr ging bald zu Ende, und die jungen Bosse versammelten sich mit ihren Pflanzen, um den Geschäftsführer zu treffen. Jim sagte seiner Frau, dass er den leeren Topf nicht mitnehmen würde, aber sie schaffte es, ihn zu überreden, um den Manager zu erzählen, was passiert war. Er war sehr nervös.\\ 
\textit{The year soon came to an end, and the young bosses gathered together with their plants to meet the general manager. Jim told his wife that he would not take the empty pot, but she, however, managed to persuade him, telling him to tell the manager fairly what had happened. He was very nervous.}\\ 

Er dachte, dass dies der unangenehmste Moment für ihn im Leben sein wird. Trotzdem wusste sie, dass sie Recht hatte und war fest davon überzeugt, dass er nichts falsch gemacht hatte. Er nahm seinen Topf mit in den Besprechungsraum. Er sah wunderschöne Pflanzen auf dem Tisch. Sie waren alle groß und ausgewachsen.\\ 
\textit{He thought that this would be the most unpleasant moment for him in life. Still, she knew she was right and was firmly convinced that there was nothing he did wrong. He took his pot in the meeting room. He saw beautiful plants on the table. They were all big and fully grown.}\\ 

Er stellte seinen leeren Topf auf den Boden, während andere lachten. Als der Geschäftsführer ankam, schaute er durch alle Pflanzen und begrüßte die Kandidaten. Jim versuchte, so weit von ihm entfernt zu sein, damit er es nicht sehen würde.\\ 
\textit{He put his empty pot on the floor, while others were laughing. When the general manager arrived, he looked through all the plants and greeted the candidates. Jim tried to be as far away from him, so that he would not see it.}\\ 

""Wie schön!"" sagte der Geschäftsführer. ""Ich sehe, dass es jetzt nicht einfach sein wird, einen neuen Manager auszuwählen ..."" Und in diesem Moment sah er den leeren Topf. Er hat den Vizepräsidenten gebeten, ihn zu nehmen und den Eigentümer zu ihm zu bringen. Jim trat heraus.\\ 
\textit{""How beautiful!"" the general manager said. ""I see that it will not be easy to pick a new manager now ..."" And, at that moment, he saw the empty pot. He asked the vice president to take it and bring the owner to him. Jim stepped out.}\\ 

""Oh Gott ... Vielleicht werde ich jetzt rausgeschmissen"", dachte er.\\ 
\textit{""Oh God ... Maybe I'll get kicked out of the company now,"" he thought.}\\ 

Als er kam, fragte ihn der Manager, was mit seinem Samen passierte. Und Jim war ganz ehrlich und er entschuldigte sich. Der Manager bat dann alle sich zu sitzen - außer Jim. Er sah sie an und sagte:\\ 
\textit{When he came, the general manager asked him what happened to his seed. And Jim was all honest and he apologized. The general manager then asked everyone to sit - except for Jim. He looked at them and said:}\\ 

""Jim, ich bin sehr stolz auf dich ... Jim ist der neue CEO der Firma!""\\ 
\textit{""Jim, I'm very proud of you. Jim is the new CEO of the company!""}\\ 

""Nun ... wie ist das möglich? Mein Topf ist leer ..."", fragte Jim verwirrt.\\ 
\textit{""Well ... how is that possible? My pot is empty. "" Jim asked confused.}\\ 

Der alte Manager erklärte: ""Vor einem Jahr gab ich jedem von euch einen toten Samen. Es war unmöglich, dass etwas daraus wächst. Jeder von euch, der sah, dass nichts passierte, beschloss es durch gesunde Samen zu ersetzen. Jeder von euch - Außer Jim. Ihr alle habt mir Pflanzen und Blumen gebracht. Nur Jim war stolz auf das Versagen und hatte genug Mut und Ehrlichkeit, mir einen leeren Topf zu bringen. Ihr wolltet Erfolg - um jeden Preis, und Jims Ehrlichkeit war wichtiger als Erfolg. Deshalb ist er heute der CEO ... ""\\ 
\textit{The old general manager explained: ""One year ago I gave each of you a dead seed. It was impossible that something could grow out of it. Each of you, seeing nothing to grow, decided to replace it with healthy seeds. Each of you - except Jim. You all brought me plants and flowers. Only Jim was proud of the failure and had enough courage and honesty to bring me an empty seed. You all wanted success - at all cost, and Jim's honesty was more important than success. That is why he is the CEO today. ""}

"Give me a combination of a writing exercise and a creative writing exercise for a 5th grade student learning English. The exercise should contain some kind of a graphic component (illustration, diagram, table, etc). It should be an exercise on story continuation.","The three hobbits, Merry, Pippin, and Frodo, found themselves deep in the heart of a dark and twisted forest. The trees loomed high above them, their branches tangled like fingers clawing at the sky. Shadows flickered all around, and even the faintest sounds seemed louder, echoing eerily among the trunks.

Merry, always the cheerful one, tried to keep everyone’s spirits up. Though he was feeling uncertain, he whistled softly to himself as they walked, hoping his calmness might rub off on the others. Occasionally, he caught a glimpse of what he thought was a path, and he felt a little surge of relief every time they seemed to be going in the right direction.

But Pippin was struggling. The darkness, the strange sounds, and the constant feeling of being lost gnawed at him. At one point, he couldn’t hold back his frustration anymore. “I can’t bear it!” he shouted, breaking the silence and startling the others. It felt as though the trees were closing in on him, and he began to doubt whether they’d ever find their way out.

Frodo, leading the way, tried to stay hopeful, though doubts were creeping into his mind. Every turn looked the same, and after a while, he began to wonder if they were going in circles. “What if there’s no way through?” he murmured to himself, his voice barely audible. But he kept moving forward, hoping against hope that they would eventually find an escape.

Then, just as despair began to settle in, Merry caught sight of something up ahead—a path, winding its way through the trees and leading toward what looked like the edge of the forest. He let out a low whistle of relief, and Frodo and Pippin quickly followed his gaze. Could this be their way out?

Give me a reading comprehension exercise for a student learning French. It should have a subsection for answers.,"Un après-midi nuageux, alors que la brise soufflait doucement pour apporter un peu de fraîcheur, un vieil homme et sa petite-fille entrèrent dans une boutique de bibelots au bord de la mer. \\
Tandis que le vieil homme alla parler avec le propriétaire de la boutique qui était son ami, la petite fille profita de l'occasion pour regarder autour d'elle et observer ce qu'il y avait dans la boutique comme articles. \\

Elle admira les différents petits bibelots qui paraissaient être des souvenirs ramenés de voyages à travers différents et lointains mondes. \\
Elle vit quelques carillons éoliens, tous de différentes couleurs et tailles, ce qui indiquait qu'ils étaient collectionnés à travers les années plutôt que fournis en gros depuis un stock d'usine. \\
Elle passa les doigts à travers eux et se détendit en entendant le son de leur doux tintement avant de passer à l'objet suivant qui attira son attention : les capteurs de rêves. \\

Les objets circulaires avaient des filets tissés en différents motifs et décorés avec des perles colorées ainsi que de très belles plumes qui étaient suspendues sur la partie inférieure. \\
Chaque capteur de rêves paraissait unique et différent des autres. \\
Après qu'elle les eut admirés assez longtemps, elle se tourna vers les jolies poupées russes qui étaient mises en valeur sur une étagère qui leur avait été dédiée. \\

Elle rigola en voyant à quel point les poupées rondes étaient mignonnes et sourit avec affection en admirant leurs couleurs. \\
En dessous, il y avait des œufs de joaillier, émaillés d'or et d'argent et incrustés de pierres précieuses qui brillaient dans la faible lueur. \\
Ils avaient l'air très chers et elle se demanda ce qu'ils faisaient dans une boutique de bibelots au lieu d'être dans une bijouterie. \\

Cependant, ce qui attira le plus l'attention de la petite fille étaient les bateaux en bouteilles qui étaient dans un coin de la boutique. \\
Ils étaient sur un présentoir de façon à ce que chaque bateau soit sur une étagère. \\
Certains étaient plus larges que les autres mais ils inspiraient tous la même émotion : l'émerveillement. \\

\textit{-As-tu trouvé quelque chose qui t'a plu, Aria ?} son grand-père dit de l'autre côté du magasin où le comptoir se situait. \\
\textit{-Je suis juste en train d'observer !} répondit-elle sans détourner son regard des bateaux en bouteilles. \\
\textit{-Mais, comment... ?} murmura-t-elle. \textit{Comment étaient-ils faits ?} Était-ce ce qu'elle se demandait. \\
Comment est-ce que les gens étaient arrivés à faire rentrer des bateaux de cette taille dans des bouteilles à travers leurs petites ouvertures ? \\

Le propriétaire du magasin et son grand-père se rendirent où elle se tenait et tandis que son grand-père serra un bras autour de ses épaules, l'autre homme prit l'une des bouteilles. \\
\textit{-Tu te demandes comment ils sont faits, n'est-ce pas ?} il questionna avec un doux regard. \\
\textit{-Oui ! Comment avez-vous su ?} Le vieil homme rigola et lui tapota la tête tendrement. \\

\textit{-Tout le monde se pose cette question quand ils les voient,} dit-il en lui passant la bouteille. \\

Aria tendit ses mains et lui prit le bateau. Elle le tint au niveau de ses yeux et plissa ceux-ci pour voir tous les détails du bateau. \\
Il était fait en bois et les voiles semblaient être faites en papier. Tout avait l'air réel, du nom peint sur le côté du bateau au nid de pie sur le point le plus haut. \\

\textit{-Alors... vous savez comment ça a été fait ?} demanda-t-elle curieusement au propriétaire de la boutique en lui repassant le précieux objet. \\
Le vieil homme hocha la tête et se tourna vers elle après avoir remis la bouteille à sa place. \\

\textit{-Certains croient qu'il y a longtemps de cela, quand les marins oubliaient leurs bouteilles ouvertes avant de s'endormir, de toutes petites créatures sortaient de leurs cachettes et construisaient des bateaux qui flottaient sur le liquide qui était dans la bouteille.} \\
\textit{Quand le liquide séchait au lever du jour, les créatures disparaissaient après avoir fini leur tâche et seul le bateau restait dans la bouteille, la rendant inutilisable.} \\

\textit{Les marins n'avaient pas d'autres choix que de garder les bateaux en bouteilles pour décorer ou les vendre aux touristes.} \\

Émerveillée par la légende, Aria ne dit rien à travers le récit du vieux vendeur. \\

\textit{-Cependant,} le vieil homme reprit la parole. \\
\textit{-Les humains commencèrent à copier le travail des minuscules êtres et commencèrent à créer ces modèles eux-mêmes.} \\

\textit{D'ailleurs,} dit-il en regardant son grand-père. \\
\textit{-Ton vieillard sait comment les fabriquer. Tous ces modèles ont été faits par ton grand-père !} \\

Aria laissa échapper un souffle et tourna la tête pour faire face à son grand-père. \\
\textit{-Vraiment ?} murmura-t-elle. \\

Grand-père rigola et la serra contre lui. \\
\textit{-En effet. On peut en faire un quand on rentre à la maison si tu veux,} lui dit-il. \\
\textit{-Oui, s'il te plaît !} dit-elle avec grand enthousiasme. \\

Tenant sa parole, lorsqu'ils retournèrent chez lui, grand-père ramena du bois, du papier, de la colle et d'autres matériaux dont ils avaient besoin pour faire le modèle. \\
\textit{-Tout d'abord, on va construire la base du bateau,} son grand-père lui dit en prenant un morceau de bois et en commençant à le sculpter avant de le peindre en marron foncé. \\

\textit{-Puis, on commence par le glisser à l'intérieur de la bouteille. On va monter les différentes pièces du bateau à l'intérieur de la bouteille.} \\
Il fit cela avant de demander à sa petite fille de dessiner des formes de voiles sur le papier. \\

\textit{-Maintenant, coupe-les pendant que je noue le fil qui va servir de cordes à la base du bateau.} \\

Les deux travaillèrent en silence, chacun plongé dans sa tâche et quand il était temps pour la touche finale, grand-père utilisa deux longs crochets en métal pour tirer les fils qui étaient noués aux voiles et en tirant rapidement sur eux, les voiles s'étendirent et l'œuvre fut terminée. \\

\textit{-Juste un dernier petit détail,} dit-il en lui passant le bouchon en liège. \\
\textit{-Tu veux bien ?} \\

\textit{-Avec plaisir !} Aria prit la pièce en bois dans sa main et l'inséra dans l'ouverture de la bouteille en verre. \\
\textit{-Voilà. C'est fini !}

Give me a reading comprehension exercise for a student learning French. It should have a subsection for answers.,"Un beau jour ensoleillé, les élèves de la garderie \textit{Le Lièvre} partirent en randonnée dans le bois avec leur institutrice. Celle-ci avait choisi un itinéraire assez facile pour les tout-petits et marchait à un rythme lent pour ne pas les fatiguer.\\

-- Zoé ? Clément, un des petits garçons qui marchaient en queue, appela sa sœur.\\

-- Oui ? répondit son aînée.\\

Zoé trouvait l'activité à son goût. Depuis toute petite, elle aimait marcher, courir et sauter. C'était une fillette très active, contrairement à son petit frère gâté qui préférait se faire porter.\\

-- J'ai faim. Quand est-ce qu'on va manger ? demanda-t-il.\\

-- On mangera quand on arrivera aux chalets. Mademoiselle Ludivine nous l'a déjà dit.\\

-- Mais j...\\

Avant qu'il ne puisse finir sa phrase, Clément trébucha sur une pierre et tomba. Il se redressa mais resta agenouillé, gémissant de douleur en s'essuyant le visage. Zoé, exaspérée par son petit frère étourdi, soupira et s'arrêta pour l'aider.\\

-- Tu es tombé parce que tes lacets sont défaits. Regarde ! dit-elle en indiquant ses chaussures d'un mouvement de tête.\\

-- Ah ! Une minute, je vais les refaire !\\

Distrait, Clément cessa de pleurer et se concentra sur ses lacets, mais après plusieurs tentatives infructueuses, sa grande sœur perdit patience. Elle s'accroupit pour les refaire elle-même.\\

-- Laisse-moi faire, sinon on y passera la journée, dit-elle.\\

Une fois ses chaussures sécurisées, Clément et sa sœur reprirent leur route pour rejoindre les autres. Mais après une bonne dizaine de minutes, ils réalisèrent qu'ils s'étaient séparés du groupe.\\

-- Ah ! Ils ont avancé drôlement vite, dis donc ! remarqua Zoé.\\

Les deux continuèrent à marcher jusqu'à une bifurcation.\\

-- Tu crois qu'ils sont partis par où ? demanda Clément.\\

-- Je n'en sais rien. Mais on doit choisir.\\

-- Je vais le faire ! répondit son frère.\\

\textit{Am stram gram, pique et pique et colégram, bourre et bourre et ratatam, am stram gram !}\\

Il chanta en pointant le doigt sur les deux chemins, puis déclara qu'ils iraient à gauche. Zoé accepta, et ils se remirent en route. En chemin, Clément se plaignit de la chaleur, de la fatigue et de la faim. Zoé, l'ignorant, lui tendit sa gourde.\\

-- Bois un peu d'eau, dit-elle.\\

Ils marchèrent en silence avant que Clément demande à nouveau quand ils arriveraient.\\

-- Je n'en sais pas plus que toi, Clément ! répondit-elle. D'ailleurs, je crois que nous sommes perdus...\\

Clément, tentant de garder son calme, se rassura en pensant que sa grande sœur, courageuse et intelligente, trouverait une solution.\\

-- Qu'est-ce qu'on va faire maintenant ? demanda-t-il.\\

-- Peut-être qu'on doit rester ici et attendre qu'on nous envoie de l'aide. Mademoiselle Ludivine finira par se rendre compte de notre absence tôt ou tard... dit Zoé avec incertitude.\\

Désirant aider, Clément lui suggéra quelques solutions.\\

-- Peut-être qu'on devrait grimper sur l'arbre le plus haut pour repérer le camp.\\

-- Ce serait trop dangereux, soupira Zoé.\\

-- Alors, on peut continuer à marcher jusqu'au sommet de la montagne.\\

-- On ne sait même pas quel chemin prendre pour atteindre le sommet...\\

-- On peut --\\

-- Non, Clément ! On ne peut rien faire ! Arrête de m'agacer ! On va rester ici et attendre que quelqu'un vienne pour nous ! cria Zoé, à bout de patience.\\

Vexé par le ton de sa sœur, Clément commença à pleurer. Zoé, regrettant son éclat de colère, le prit dans ses bras pour s'excuser.\\

-- Allez, viens, on va manger. Je sais que tu as faim, lui dit-elle en le menant vers une souche.\\

Les deux sortirent leurs boîtes à lunch et commencèrent à manger. Au bout d'un moment, Clément aperçut un écureuil qui les guettait depuis un arbre.\\

-- Je crois qu'il a faim, dit Zoé.\\

-- Maman nous a mis de la tarte aux noix de pécan, tu veux lui en offrir un peu ?\\

Clément, enthousiaste, prit un morceau de tarte et s'approcha doucement de l'animal, qui commença à manger dans sa main. Quand tous furent rassasiés, une voix les surprit :\\

-- Vous êtes perdus, n'est-ce pas ?\\

Zoé et Clément regardèrent autour d'eux jusqu'à ce que la voix leur dise de regarder en bas. Bouche bée, ils réalisèrent qu'elle venait de l'écureuil.\\

-- I-i-il parle ! cria Clément.\\

-- C'est exact, dit l'écureuil avec un petit sourire espiègle.\\

-- Z-Z-Zoé ! Il parle ! balbutia Clément, tournant vers sa sœur pétrifiée.\\

L'écureuil lâcha un soupir, plus ennuyé qu'amusé maintenant.\\

-- Mais évidemment que je parle. Tout le monde parle dans le bois enchanté !\\

Cela fit enfin sortir Zoé de son état de transe.\\

-- Le bois enchanté ? répéta-t-elle.\\

-- Comme je viens de le dire, rétorqua l'animal. Mais j'y pense, je ne me suis pas encore présenté. Je m'appelle Félix. Félix DuBois, ajouta-t-il.\\

Clément éclata de rire au jeu de mots, tandis que Zoé se présenta, elle et son frère.\\

-- Pour vous remercier d'avoir partagé votre repas avec moi, que diriez-vous si je vous conduisais à votre troupeau ?\\

-- On a un troupeau ? chuchota Clément.\\

-- Il parle de nos camarades et de Mademoiselle Ludivine, l'informa Zoé.\\

-- Alors, qu'en dites-vous ?\\

-- Oui ! Oui... on vous en serait très reconnaissants, Monsieur DuBois ! dit Zoé avec un sourire.\\

-- Appelez-moi Félix. Monsieur DuBois est mon père, dit-il avant de leur demander de le suivre.\\

Ils marchèrent un moment en silence, puis Clément commença à interroger leur guide.\\

-- Et vous êtes sûr que vous n'avez pas de pouvoirs magiques ? demanda-t-il.\\

-- Sûr et certain, mon petit, répondit l'écureuil patiemment.\\

-- Et les autres habitants du bois ? Est-ce qu'ils en ont ?\\

-- Hmm... eh bien, oui. Certains, comme les vieux chênes, les loups, ou l'aigle.\\

Clément écoutait avec des yeux brillants d'émerveillement. Félix continua :\\

-- Le vieux chêne a le pouvoir de guérison. Les animaux blessés viennent souvent à lui pour demander de l'aide. Il est aussi le plus vieux de la forêt, après tout.\\

Ils marchèrent encore un peu avant d'atteindre la cascade sacrée, l'endroit où les animaux se désaltèrent. Ils y virent toutes sortes d'animaux. Clément, impressionné, serra la main de sa sœur.\\

-- C'est bizarre, je ne le vois pas. Il devrait être ici, dit Félix. Octave, notre aigle, vient toujours à cette heure...\\

Une louve au pelage blanc salua Félix.\\

-- Bonjour, Félix. Toujours aussi radieuse, Hélène, répondit Félix. Aurais-tu vu Octave ?\\

-- Il est malade. Tu le trouveras sûrement près du vieux chêne, dit-elle.\\

Félix guida les enfants vers le chêne.\\

-- Bonjour, Aristide. Nous cherchons Octave, nous a-t-on dit qu'il est chez toi.\\

-- Bonjour, Félix et petits humains, répondit une voix masculine. Octave n'est pas en forme, mais je peux vous aider.\\

Après une explication, Aristide offrit de soulever Félix pour lui permettre de repérer leur groupe. Un instant plus tard, Félix annonça :\\

-- Ils sont par-là ! Et pas très loin, heureusement.\\

Les enfants remercièrent le chêne et reprirent leur chemin.\\

-- Pourquoi n'as-tu pas grimpé sur le chêne ? demanda Clément.\\

-- Parce que cela aurait été offensant pour Aristide ! cria Félix. Non, mais grimper le vieux chêne... quel scandale...\\

-- Je vous prie de l'excuser, il n'est pas instruit sur votre culture, dit Zoé.\\

-- Peu importe, peu importe... répondit Félix.\\

Après une bonne demi-heure, Félix déclara qu'ils étaient arrivés.\\

-- Marchez tout droit, tournez à droite au grand sapin et vous verrez votre troupeau. Mais promettez de garder le silence sur tout ce que vous avez vu.\\

Zoé et Clément firent la promesse, remercièrent Félix, et repartirent. Une fois arrivés au camp, Mademoiselle Ludivine les accueillit avec soulagement.\\

-- Comment avez-vous retrouvé votre chemin ? demanda-t-elle.\\

-- Euh, on a juste marché et on s'est retrouvés ici par chance, dit Zoé en clignant de l'œil à son frère.\\

Give me a reading comprehension exercise for a student learning French. It should have a subsection for answers.,"Après avoir fini de ranger sa chambre, Alexandre, satisfait de son accomplissement et réjoui par le beau temps, décida qu'il méritait une récompense.\\
Il passa quelques minutes à penser à quelque chose qui lui ferait plaisir et que Maman ne lui refuserait pas. Il décida de profiter du beau temps et de passer le reste de la journée dehors.\\

Il alla alors chercher Maman et la trouva dans le salon, en train de passer l'aspirateur.\\
Il se tint droit et attendit qu'elle débranche l'engin pour passer à un autre coin de la pièce, puis, il l'appela.\\

-- Maman ?\\

-- Oui, mon chéri ? répondit-elle avec un sourire.\\

C'était un bon signe ; il y avait peu de chances de refus si elle était de bonne humeur.\\

-- J'ai fini de ranger ma chambre, et je me disais qu'il serait bien si on allait faire un pique-nique maintenant… dit Alexandre avec un regard suppliant.\\

Maman lui sourit tristement avant de lui dire qu'elle était trop occupée pour le moment et qu'il lui restait encore plein de corvées.\\

-- S'il te plaît ! Il fait si beau dehors !\\

-- Mais je ne peux pas laisser tout ce travail fait à moitié, mon chou. Tu sais que je peux seulement nettoyer la maison pendant le week-end à cause de mon travail, expliqua-t-elle.\\

-- D'accord, je peux t'attendre. Quand est-ce que tu vas finir de faire le ménage ?\\

Maman soupira avant de céder.\\

-- Peut-être dans une heure… ou moins, si je fais plus vite. Tu peux aller chercher la couverture de pique-nique et l'installer dans le jardin pendant que je termine. Tu la trouveras dans le placard.\\

Alexandre remercia sa Maman et courut faire ce qu'elle lui avait demandé.\\
Il lutta un peu contre la couverture, qui était coincée sous les draps, avant de la tirer du placard et alla au jardin pour choisir l'endroit parfait où la mettre.\\
D'abord, il pensa à la mettre près des fleurs, mais changea d'avis en voyant les abeilles butiner.\\
Ensuite, il essaya de poser la couverture au centre du jardin, sur l'herbe fraîchement tondue, mais le soleil tapait trop fort.\\
Finalement, il installa la couverture sous l'ombre d'un arbre, l'endroit parfait.\\

Une fois sa tâche accomplie, Alexandre regarda la couverture et pensa que la couleur verte des carrés qui la composaient ressemblait à celle de l'herbe.\\
Alors qu'il remarquait ce détail, il aperçut du coin de l'œil quelques fourmis grimper sur la couverture.\\
Il les chassa, puis s'allongea sur la couverture pour admirer le ciel en attendant que sa mère le rejoigne.\\
Bercé par les nuages et la douce chaleur du printemps, Alexandre s'endormit. Une petite sieste lui ferait du bien avant le repas de midi.\\

Alexandre ne sut pas combien de temps s'était écoulé avant qu'il ne se réveille, désorienté. Cependant, en regardant autour de lui, il se trouva dans une chambre qu'il ne reconnaissait pas.\\
C'était une grande pièce avec du papier peint ressemblant à celui de chez sa grand-mère, un barreau en bois et une cheminée.\\
Il jeta les draps qu'il ne reconnaissait pas par-dessus lui et tenta de quitter le lit, mais échoua et fit une chute.\\

Mais qu'est-ce qu'il faisait dans ce lit de géant ?!\\

Il se leva du sol et se dirigea vers le grand balcon. Ce qu'il vit le surprit au point de lui couper le souffle.\\
La vue était sublime : une grande plaine formée de carrés alternant de couleur, tantôt un vert d'herbe, tantôt un blanc de marguerite.\\
Un peu plus loin, il vit un village avec plein de petites maisons et de chalets.\\

Lorsqu'il avança davantage sur le balcon, il aperçut un jardin avec un labyrinthe d'un côté, des rosiers de l'autre et une fontaine au centre.\\
Curieux, il se pencha sur les rails du balcon et leva la tête pour voir l'endroit offrant une si belle vue. Il s'agissait d'un château.\\

Alexandre n'y comprenait rien. Il décida de retourner à l'intérieur et de s'habiller pour découvrir où il se trouvait.\\
Il avait à peine fait un pas lorsqu'un homme entra dans la chambre avec un “Bonjour, messire !”\\

Alexandre le regarda avec hésitation. Il voulait lui demander qui il était, mais les mots le trahirent, et il le scruta en silence.\\

-- Je vois que quelqu'un s'est levé du mauvais pied aujourd'hui… murmura l'homme, qui se tourna ensuite vers l'armoire pour fouiller dedans.\\

-- Que faites-vous ? dit Alexandre, retrouvant enfin sa voix.\\

-- Hmm ? Le monsieur se tourna vers lui, pencha la tête et fronça les sourcils. Ce que je fais chaque matin, évidemment. Je vous prépare votre tenue !\\

-- M-ma tenue ? Ça fait presque deux ans que je m'habille tout seul ! Merci, mais je peux me débrouiller, répondit Alexandre, offensé.\\

Non, mais ! Il le prenait pour qui ?\\

L'homme, semblant tout aussi perplexe, lui répondit d'un ton sévère :\\

-- Je suis votre valet, Monsieur. C'est mon travail.\\

\emph{Hein ?!!!}\\

Give me a reading comprehension exercise for a student learning French. It should have a subsection for answers.,"Un matin chaud en été vit deux enfants assis devant la télévision, regardant l'écran, épatés par une artiste martiale qui démontrait quelques mouvements sophistiqués. \\
\textit{-Woah... !} Beth exclama et dut se rappeler de ne pas cligner des yeux pour ne rien rater. \\
\textit{-C'est tellement cool !} son cousin dit. Il regardait l'émission avec elle dès le début et parut aussi impressionné qu'elle l'était, avec les yeux grands ouverts et de petits souffles à chaque fois qu'un mouvement était démontré. \\
\textit{-Oui !} agrée Beth avec enthousiasme avant que les deux ne se turent de nouveau pour se concentrer sur l'émission. \\
Les deux restèrent ainsi jusqu'à la fin de l'émission et ne se levèrent que lorsqu'ils furent appelés pour descendre prendre leur déjeuner. \\
\textit{-Je veux devenir une artiste martiale quand je serai grande !} la petite fille dit en sautant les marches de l'escalier. \\
\textit{-Pas moi !} dit son cousin en courant derrière elle avec maladresse. \\
Ses mots la firent froncer les yeux en confusion. N'était-il pas aussi impressionné qu'elle, tout à l'heure ? Comment pouvait-il dire ça ? \\
\textit{-Pourquoi pas ?} demanda-t-elle sur un ton qui reflétait autant de surprise qu'elle avait ressentie. \\
\textit{-J'ai entendu dire que les artistes martiaux doivent s'entraîner très dur. J'ai aussi entendu dire qu'ils doivent casser leurs os et se déchirer les muscles pour devenir aussi forts qu'ils le sont,} répondit-il. \\
\textit{-Tu n'es pas sérieux !} exclama-t-elle. C'était horrible ! Qui peut bien subir une telle torture ? Beth frémit en pensant au fait de subir cette douleur pour devenir un bon artiste martial et elle pensa qu'elle devrait peut-être y repenser. \\

Mais elle continua à penser à l'émission qu'elle avait regardée tout à l'heure et à quel point la dame était cool quand elle donnait des coups de poing et des coups de pied aux planches en bois. \\
Elle voulait vraiment être comme elle. Peut-être qu'elle pourrait prendre des médicaments qui l'aideraient à supporter la douleur quand elle commencerait à s'entraîner ? \\
Elle regarda son cousin et plissa les yeux. Peut-être que Bobby avait tort à propos de ce qu'il lui avait dit tout à l'heure... Et puis, d'où il savait, lui ? \\
Elle devait poser la question à quelqu'un de confiance et elle savait exactement à qui s'adresser ! \\

Plus tard dans la journée, quand son cousin fit sa sieste, elle descendit parler à son grand frère qui était chargé de rester avec eux pendant que leurs parents étaient absents pour la journée. \\
\textit{-Coucou, Keith !} elle le salua avec bonne humeur. Son grand frère était la personne la plus intelligente qu'elle connaissait. Plus intelligent que ses parents, même ! \\
Il répondait toujours à ses questions et même quand il ne connaissait pas la réponse, il la cherchait pour elle. \\
\textit{-Coucou, sœurette !} répondit-il avec un sourire en fermant le livre qu'il était en train de lire. \\
\textit{-Que puis-je faire pour toi ?} dit-il en lui pinçant le nez avec un sourire taquin. \\
Beth rigola et s'assit à côté de lui sur le canapé. \\
\textit{-J'ai une question pour toi.} Elle commença. Quand son frère hocha la tête, elle continua. \\
\textit{-Est-ce qu'il est vrai que les artistes martiaux doivent se briser les os et se déchirer les muscles quand ils s'entraînent pour devenir plus forts ?} \\

Les yeux de son grand frère devinrent plus larges et il prit un moment avant de lui répondre. \\
\textit{-Je suis sûr que ce n'est pas le cas. Qui te l'a dit ?} \\
\textit{-Bobby.} \\
\textit{-Eh bien, comme je te l'ai dit, je ne crois pas que c'est vrai, mais regardons sur internet juste pour être certains.} \\

Beth regarda Keith sortir son téléphone de sa poche et taper dessus avant de lire ce qui était écrit sur l'écran pendant quelques instants. \\
\textit{-Bon, c'est un peu correct, en quelque sorte.} Beth laissa échapper un souffle d'horreur, le poussant à lever une main pour la calmer. \\
\textit{-Mais, ce n'est pas aussi douloureux que ce qu'on croit.} \\

Beth parut un peu soulagée par ces mots. \\
\textit{-Eh bien, c'est comment alors ?} demanda-t-elle avec curiosité. \\
Si ce n'était pas de la torture comme elle le croyait, alors elle avait encore une chance pour devenir une artiste martiale dans le futur. \\
Elle était une fille costaud et elle pourrait supporter un peu de douleur ! L'autre jour, elle était tombée et s'était blessée au genou, mais elle n'avait même pas pleuré ! \\

Keith sourit et lui ébouriffa les cheveux. Il tint son téléphone en face d'elle et pointa l'écran du doigt. \\
\textit{-D'après cet article, quand les gens s'entraînent pour un sport qui nécessite de frapper quelque chose ou quelqu'un, ils doivent donner des coups avec leurs mains, pieds, genoux et tout.} Il expliqua. \\
\textit{Et des fois, ils cassent des planches en bois et des trucs du genre. Pour faire ça, ils doivent frapper à grande vitesse ou bien ils doivent être très forts. Idéalement, l'artiste martial utilise une combinaison de force et de vitesse.} \\

\textit{Pour devenir aussi forts, ils doivent s'entraîner en soulevant des poids et en faisant des exercices comme des pompes et en frappant des sacs de boxe, et c'est ce qui cause les fissures dans leurs os et leurs muscles.} \\
\textit{Mais ces fissures ne sont pas dangereuses.} l'assura-t-il avec un sourire. \\
\textit{Ce sont juste de toutes petites fissures dans leurs os et quand elles guérissent, l'os devient plus dur et plus fort dans ces endroits.} conclut-il. \\

\textit{-Ohh... ! C'est logique,} Beth dit en hochant lentement la tête. \\
\textit{-C'est la même chose pour les muscles, et ça n'arrive pas qu'aux artistes martiaux. Des gens comme ceux qui font du bodybuilding soulèvent des poids lourds et ça cause des petites fissures dans leurs muscles à cause de la charge. Quand le muscle guérit et se reconstruit, il devient plus grand et plus fort. C'est pour ça que certains artistes martiaux peuvent briser des briques avec leurs mains, parce qu'ils sont assez forts mais aussi parce qu'ils sont assez rapides quand ils les frappent.} \\

\textit{-Alors, ça ne fait pas mal du tout ?} la petite fille demanda. Elle voulait s'assurer avant de prendre sa décision. \\
\textit{-Eh bien, je suis sûr que ce genre d'entraînement peut leur donner des courbatures et leur faire un peu mal, mais ce n'est rien de dangereux et s'ils le font correctement, ils ne risquent pas de se blesser,} répondit-il. \\
\textit{Le mystère est résolu ! Es-tu satisfaite, jeune demoiselle ?} \\

Beth sourit et hocha la tête. \\
\textit{-Oui ! Maintenant que tout est clair, je veux devenir une artiste martiale !} annonça-t-elle avec fierté. \\
\textit{-Oh ? Sais-tu quel art martial tu veux pratiquer ? Le Karaté ? Le Judo ? Le Hapkido ?} demanda-t-il. \\
\textit{-Euh... je ne sais pas... encore.} \\
Keith rigola et lui dit qu'elle pouvait demander à leurs parents quand ils rentreraient. \\
\textit{-Peut-être qu'ils t'emmèneront à quelques écoles d'arts martiaux et tu pourras choisir après avoir observé les autres !}

Give me a reading comprehension exercise for a student learning French. It should have a subsection for answers.,"Margot mangeait son petit déjeuner avec appétit. Contente de recevoir une visite de son grand-père, elle s'était réveillée de bonne humeur ce matin.\\
Grand-père était le membre de la famille qu'elle préférait, son meilleur ami parmi les adultes, et elle adorait passer du temps avec lui.\\
Hier soir, lorsqu'il lui avait annoncé sa visite imminente au téléphone, il lui avait promis un cadeau et elle était surexcitée.\\
D'ailleurs, elle avait eu des difficultés à se coucher tellement elle était émoustillée.\\

Grand-père arriva à 10h du matin. Il embrassa Maman et Papa avant de prendre Margot dans ses bras.\\

-- Et comment va ma petite fille préférée ? demanda-t-il, ses yeux chaleureux regardant Margot avec tendresse.\\

Margot rigola et répondit avec humour :\\

-- Je suis ta seule petite fille, grand-père ! Et je vais très bien, merci !\\

Puis elle ajouta :\\

-- Et comment va mon grand-père préféré ?\\

Grand-père, surpris par l'espièglerie de Margot, laissa échapper un rire avant de lui assurer que, lui aussi, allait très bien.\\

-- Mais je sais qu'il y a quelque chose que tu veux avoir plus que mes nouvelles, hein ? dit grand-père avec un air taquin.\\

Margot ne sut comment répondre, elle se tortilla un peu avant de le regarder avec ses grands yeux innocents, mais grand-père n'était pas dupe.\\
Il la posa par terre et ils se dirigèrent tous deux vers le canapé.\\

Assis l'un à côté de l'autre, Margot regardait grand-père plonger sa main dans un sac en papier avant d'en sortir un petit pot en argile contenant une plante épineuse.\\
Margot pencha la tête par curiosité et scruta la plante que son grand-père avait posée sur la petite table en face d'eux.\\

-- C'est ta surprise, ma chérie. J'espère qu'elle te plaît, lui dit-il.\\

-- C'est quoi ? répondit-elle, tout en se mettant à genoux devant la table pour observer la plante de plus près.\\

-- Eh bien, c'est une plante. Un cactus, pour être plus précis, répondit grand-père avec amusement.\\

Margot hocha la tête avec grand intérêt. Un moment plus tard, elle étendit sa main pour toucher la plante ronde mais son élan fut interrompu par grand-père, qui lui attrapa la main avant qu'elle ne puisse la toucher.\\

-- Attention à ne pas te faire piquer, dit-il, en indiquant les petites épines qui recouvraient la surface du cactus.\\

-- Qu'est-ce que je suis censée faire avec ? demanda Margot, toujours sans quitter des yeux la plante qui la fascinait.\\

-- T'en occuper et la faire pousser. Est-ce que ça te tente ?\\

-- Oui, je veux bien essayer !\\

Une fois grand-père rentré chez lui, Margot emmena la plante dans sa chambre.\\
Elle l'installa devant sa fenêtre et l'admira dans son nouvel entourage.\\
Se rappelant que son grand-père lui avait dit qu'elle devait s'en occuper et, sachant que Papa arrosait toujours les plantes du balcon, Margot décida de faire la même chose.\\
Elle alla chercher un verre d'eau et le versa dans le pot, autour de la plante.\\

-- Je vais te donner à boire tous les jours ! dit-elle au petit cactus.\\

Satisfaite, elle alla faire sa toilette avant d'aller au lit.\\

Pendant les jours qui suivirent, Margot arrosait son cactus régulièrement. Elle s'assurait qu'il eût assez de soleil et aéra sa chambre tous les matins.\\
Elle demandait aussi à son père d'enlever les petits insectes et parasites qui se posaient sur sa petite plante adorée qu'elle cultivait avec amour.\\

Cependant, malgré ses efforts, son petit cactus commença à perdre son éclat.\\
Sa belle couleur verte devint pâle et Margot sut qu'il se portait mal.\\
Elle se rappela de ce qui était arrivé aux plantes que son père avait négligées lorsqu'ils étaient partis en vacances l'an dernier.\\

Refusant de laisser son cactus mourir, Margot redoubla d'efforts.\\
Elle commença à l'arroser deux fois par jour et l'emmena au balcon pour lui garantir plus de soleil et d'air frais.\\
Mais, malheureusement, cela ne changea rien et l'état de sa plante s'empira.\\

Désespérée, Margot passa un coup de fil à Grand-père pour lui dire ce qui se passait.\\

-- Mon cactus est en train de mourir, pourtant j'en ai pris bien soin ! cria-t-elle, les larmes aux yeux.\\

Son grand-père lui demanda de lui expliquer comment elle s'en occupait, espérant identifier ce qui avait bien pu contrarier la petite plante.\\
Margot prit le temps de lui raconter sa routine et, une fois qu'elle eut fini, grand-père lui dit :\\

-- Je suis désolé, ma puce. Je t'ai donné le cactus mais j'ai négligé de t'expliquer comment t'en occuper.\\
Vois-tu, un cactus est différent des autres plantes. Il ne demande pas beaucoup d'eau.\\
En fait, tu as seulement besoin de l'arroser une fois par semaine. En l'arrosant chaque jour, c'est comme si tu le noyais et les racines deviennent pourries en conséquence.\\

-- Et donc, qu'est-ce que je dois faire maintenant ? demanda-t-elle.\\

-- Ne fais rien. Je viens te voir demain. On va enlever la partie pourrie, s'il y en a, et on va rempoter ton cactus dans du terreau sec.\\
Allez, sèche tes larmes, ma petite, tout va bien se passer.\\

Margot, rassurée par les mots de son grand-père, cessa de pleurer. Elle le remercia avant de raccrocher et répéta les mots de son grand-père à la petite plante :\\

-- Tout ira bien, on va te sauver.\\

Le lendemain, grand-père tint sa parole et arriva chez Margot le matin.\\
Il avait apporté un pot neuf et un sac de terreau spécial cactus. Margot le regarda avec attention.\\
Elle le vit retirer la plante de son pot actuel, enlever le terreau boueux des racines avant d'en couper une grande partie.\\
Ensuite, il mit des cailloux dans le fond du nouveau pot avant d'y verser du terreau.\\
Il posa le cactus au centre avant de se tapoter les mains pour se débarrasser du terreau qui y était resté.\\

-- Voilà, cela devrait faire l'affaire, dit grand-père.\\

Avant de partir, il donna quelques astuces à Margot.\\
Il lui dit de ne pas arroser la plante pendant trois semaines et lui suggéra de la faire tourner un peu chaque jour pour faire en sorte que toutes ses parties reçoivent leur part de soleil.\\

Un mois plus tard, Margot, assise en face de sa fenêtre, chuchota à la petite plante qui avait retrouvé son éclat :\\

-- Tu vois, je t'ai bien dit qu'on allait te sauver !

Give me a combination of a word problem exercise and an explanation exercise for a 6th grade student learning mathematics. It should have a subsection for answers.,"Ingrid says, ""I can multiply by 100 by adding two zeros."" Explain why Ingrid is wrong.

\subsection*{Answers}
Ingrid's statement is incorrect because simply adding two zeros to a number does not accurately represent multiplication by 100. For example, if you take the number 5.6 and add two zeros, you get 5.600, which is not the same as multiplying 5.6 by 100, which equals 560. This method only works for whole numbers and does not apply to decimal numbers or fractions."
