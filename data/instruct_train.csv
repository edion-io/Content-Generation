Dieser Mann war sehr arm, aber er besa√ü ein Pferd, das so exquisit war, das selbst K√∂nige es ihm abkaufen wollten-  und das zu jedem Preis. Doch der Mann lehnte immer wieder ab. Pl√∂tzlich eines Morgens, stellte er fest, dass das Pferd verschwunden war. Alle Menschen aus dem Dorf versammelten um ihr Mitgef√ºhl auszudr√ºcken.\\

Sie sagten: ""Oh, was f√ºr ein Ungl√ºck, was h√§ttest du f√ºr ein Verm√∂gen mit diesem Pferd verdienen k√∂nnen und man hat dir so viel daf√ºr geboten! Aber du warst zu dickk√∂pfig und zu dumm. Jetzt ist das Pferd weg. ""\\

Aber der alte Mann lachte nur und sagte: ""Ach redet doch keinen Unsinn: ""Alles was man dar√ºber sagen kann, ist, dass das Pferd jetzt nicht mehr in seinem Stall ist. Lass die Zukunft kommen und uns zeigen was passiert""\\

Nach wenigen Tagen kehrte das Pferd pl√∂tzlich zur√ºck in seinen Stall. Nicht nur das, es brachte eine ganze Herde wilder Pferde aus dem Wald mit. Und wieder versammelte sich das ganze Dorf und sie sagten: ""Unglaublich, der alte Mann hatte Recht sein Pferd ist tats√§chlich zur√ºckgekommen, und es hat auch noch ein ganzes dutzend toller Pferde mitgebracht. Jetzt kann er so viel Geld verdienen, wie er will."" Und sie gingen zu dem alten Mann und sagten: ""Oh es tut uns Leid wir konnten das ja nicht voraussehen und die Wege Gottes verstehen, aber du bist unglaublich. Du hast es wohl irgendwie geahnt. Vielleicht kannst du sogar die Zukunft voraussehen.""\\

""So ein Quatsch."" sagte der alte Mann nur. ""Ich wei√ü nur, eins: N√§mlich, dass das Pferd mit einer ganzen Herde Pferde zur√ºckgekommen ist und was morgen geschehen wird, das wei√ü nur der liebe Gott.""\\

Und schon ein paar Tage sp√§ter geschah es, das der einzige Sohn des Mannes, der die neuen Pferde zureiten wollte, dabei vom Pferd fiel. Er brach sich dabei seine Beine so schwer, das er fortan wohl nicht mehr w√ºrde richtig laufen k√∂nnen. Die Menschen kamen wieder zu dem alten Mann und sagten: ""Du hast recht gehabt. Man wei√ü nie. Die Sache mit den Pferden hat sich als ein Fluch erwiesen. Da w√§re es besser gewesen, w√§ren die Pferde √ºberhaupt gar nicht erst gekommen. Nun wird dein Sohn f√ºr sein ganzes Leben lang verkr√ºppelt sein.\\

Aber der alte Mann sagte wieder nur: ""Nicht so voreilig. Wartet ab! Man wird sehen was geschieht. Man kann n√§mlich nur eines dar√ºber sagen, n√§mlich, dass mein Sohn sich die Beine gebrochen hat. Das ist alles.""\\

Einige Wochen sp√§ter ergab es sich das in dem Land ein Krieg ausbrach und alle die jungen M√§nner des Dorfes von der Regierung zwangsweise eingezogen wurden. Nur der Sohn des alten Mannes durfte zu Hause bleiben, weil er f√ºr den Krieg untauglich war.\\

Und wieder versammelten sich alle Menschen des Dorfes und klagten: ""Unsere S√∂hne sind fort und du hast wenigstens noch deinen Sohn. Er mag zwar seine Beine gebrochen haben, aber er ist bei dir.

\subsection*{Translation}
Once upon a time, there was a poor man who lived in a village. This man was very poor, but he owned a horse so exquisite that even kings wanted to buy it from him‚Äîat any price. Yet, the man repeatedly refused. One morning, he suddenly discovered that the horse was gone. All the villagers gathered to express their sympathy.\\

They said: ‚ÄúOh, what bad luck! You could have earned a fortune with that horse, and so many had offered you so much for it! But you were too stubborn and too foolish. Now the horse is gone.‚Äù\\

But the old man just laughed and said: ‚ÄúOh, stop talking nonsense. All that can be said about this is that the horse is no longer in its stable. Let the future come and show us what will happen.‚Äù\\

A few days later, the horse suddenly returned to its stable. Not only that, but it brought with it an entire herd of wild horses from the forest. Once again, the whole village gathered, and they said: ‚ÄúUnbelievable! The old man was right‚Äîhis horse actually came back, and it even brought a dozen fine horses with it. Now he can earn as much money as he wants.‚Äù They went to the old man and said: ‚ÄúOh, we are sorry; we could not foresee this or understand God‚Äôs ways. But you are incredible. You must have had some inkling. Maybe you can even see the future.‚Äù\\

‚ÄúNonsense,‚Äù said the old man. ‚ÄúI only know one thing: the horse came back with a whole herd of horses. What will happen tomorrow is known only to God.‚Äù\\

And just a few days later, it happened that the man‚Äôs only son, who was trying to tame the new horses, fell off one of them. He broke his legs so badly that he would likely never be able to walk properly again. The people came to the old man once more and said: ‚ÄúYou were right. One never knows. This business with the horses turned out to be a curse. It would have been better if the horses had never come at all. Now your son will be crippled for the rest of his life.‚Äù\\

But the old man again said: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be so quick to judge. Wait and see! All that can be said is that my son broke his legs. That‚Äôs all.‚Äù\\

A few weeks later, a war broke out in the land, and all the young men of the village were forcibly conscripted by the government. Only the old man‚Äôs son was allowed to stay home because he was unfit for war.\\

Once again, all the villagers gathered and lamented: ‚ÄúOur sons are gone, but at least you still have your son. He may have broken his legs, but he is here with you. Our sons are gone, and the enemy may be far more powerful. They will probably all die. Now we will have no one to care for us in our old age. But you still have your son. He will surely recover.‚Äù\\

But the old man once again said: ‚ÄúThere is only one thing that can be said: your sons were conscripted. My son stayed here. That‚Äôs all. Nothing follows from this.‚Äù\\

Give me a reading comprehension exercise for a student learning French. It should have a subsection for answers.,"Magali sourit avec satisfaction en regardant les deux pages pleines de son cahier. Finir ses devoirs lui inspirait toujours un sentiment de productivit√©. Elle commen√ßa √† ranger ses affaires lorsqu'elle entendit frapper √† sa porte. Elle vit qu'il s'agissait de sa m√®re, qui entra apr√®s avoir re√ßu sa permission.\\

-- Salut, ma ch√©rie. Que fais-tu ? dit Maman avec un tendre sourire.\\

-- Salut ! r√©pondit la fillette en haussant les √©paules. Rien du tout. Je viens de finir mes devoirs, et maintenant je n'ai plus rien √† faire.\\

-- C'est tr√®s bien, ma puce, la louangea Maman. Et √ßa tombe bien que tu n'aies plus rien √† faire, parce que j'ai quelque chose pour toi.\\

Magali s'assit sur sa chaise de bureau, attendant que Maman lui r√©v√®le ce qu'elle lui avait apport√©. Celle-ci sortit un livre cach√© derri√®re son dos et le lui tendit.\\

-- C'est un livre de coloriage et un conte de f√©es en m√™me temps, dit Maman avant de s'installer √† c√¥t√© de Magali, qui ouvrait le livre.\\

-- Tu vois, l√†. Elle lui montra une image du doigt. C'est l'illustration de r√©f√©rence. Tu dois colorier le dessin avec les m√™mes couleurs que celles qui y sont. Et dans cette partie, dit-elle en lui montrant l'autre page, se trouve l'histoire.\\

Apr√®s son explication et apr√®s que sa fille l'eut remerci√©e, Maman quitta la chambre. Magali lut l'histoire et conclut que c'√©tait un conte de f√©es typique : une princesse n'avait pour compagnie que son chien et s'ennuyait dans son palais. Sa marraine, la bonne f√©e, lui jeta un sort et transforma ses v√™tements pour qu'elle ressemble √† une villageoise. Cela lui permit de s'aventurer dans le village, o√π elle rencontra un prince qui, lui aussi, se d√©guisait pour explorer les royaumes voisins.\\

Elle trouva que c'√©tait une sorte de Cendrillon √† l'envers et ne fut pas vraiment impressionn√©e ; elle passa donc au coloriage. Mais, apr√®s deux dessins, elle jugea les illustrations peu int√©ressantes et d√©cida de prendre les choses en main. Elle allait changer l'histoire et adapter les dessins √† sa propre version du r√©cit. Elle retourna aux pages pr√©c√©dentes et commen√ßa √† r√™vasser.\\

Elle changea la couleur de la robe de la princesse, passant du rose au noir avec des traits verts. Dans sa t√™te, la princesse √©tait devenue l'ambassadrice d'une autre plan√®te. Elle dessina un trait rouge qui s'√©tendait de la baguette magique de la marraine √† la robe : c'√©tait un rayon laser. La marraine √©tait devenue vilaine et avait vol√© les v√™tements de l'ambassadrice pour l'emp√™cher de retourner sur sa plan√®te, car ses v√™tements lui permettaient de se t√©l√©porter.\\

Magali bascula dans son monde imaginaire, o√π elle devint C√©lestine, l'ambassadrice interstellaire. Apr√®s avoir perdu ses v√™tements, C√©lestine alla retrouver son gardien. Ce dernier avait pris l'apparence d'un chien, mais c'√©tait en r√©alit√© un extraterrestre humano√Øde, comme elle.\\

-- √âon ! cria-t-elle. On doit partir d'ici imm√©diatement ! Ce palais n'est plus s√ªr. J'ai d√©couvert que les humains complotent pour envahir notre plan√®te, et l'une d'eux m'a pris mon uniforme lorsqu'elle m'a rep√©r√©e.\\

-- Je n'en crois pas mes oreilles, Dame C√©lestine ! r√©pondit le chien avec horreur. Je vais contacter notre base a√©rienne pour les pr√©venir de notre arriv√©e !\\

Il se dirigea vers le miroir de la coiffeuse dans la chambre de l'ambassadrice et toucha la glace. Apr√®s quelques gestes, il se retrouva face √† une personne de son esp√®ce et lui expliqua bri√®vement ce qui s'√©tait pass√©, avant d'informer qu'ils allaient rentrer plus t√¥t que pr√©vu.\\

-- Nous devons nous rendre au village imm√©diatement, c'est l√† o√π j'ai plant√© la capsule d'urgence, dit-il √† C√©lestine.\\

-- Allons-y !\\

Les deux s'√©chapp√®rent furtivement du palais et coururent vers le village. Une fois arriv√©s, ils ralentirent pour ne pas √©veiller les soup√ßons des humains.\\

-- La capsule se trouve au fond du puits, dit √âon. C'est l√† que nous devons aller.\\

Ils se rendirent au centre du village, et √âon reprit son apparence humaine. Lui et la princesse firent semblant de se rencontrer et d'√©changer quelques mots pendant qu'il sortait discr√®tement la capsule du puits. Ils √©taient sauv√©s ! Ils mont√®rent √† bord et quitt√®rent la Terre pour informer leur peuple des manigances humaines.\\

Magali sortit de son monde imaginaire et prit soin d'effacer le chien des images o√π le prince √©tait pr√©sent ; dans sa version, c'√©tait la m√™me personne. Elle modifia √©galement la tenue et dessina la capsule spatiale. Elle tourna les pages du livre et admira fi√®rement son ≈ìuvre. Les dessins √©taient d√©sormais plus excitants, pleins de couleurs vives, de noir et de gris pour les v√™tements des extraterrestres et la capsule.\\

Maman revint avec un plateau contenant son go√ªter, pr√™te √† lui demander si elle avait aim√© le livre, mais elle s'arr√™ta en voyant les coloriages.\\

-- Pourquoi ne t'es-tu pas bas√©e sur les images de r√©f√©rence, ma ch√©rie ? demanda-t-elle.\\

-- Parce que je n'ai pas trop aim√© l'histoire, r√©pondit Magali. Alors je l'ai chang√©e.\\

Maman lui demanda de raconter sa version, et Magali le fit en utilisant ses dessins pour mieux expliquer. Maman l'applaudit et pensa qu'elle n'avait peut-√™tre pas apport√© le bon cadeau √† son enfant. Le lendemain, elle lui offrit un carnet de feuilles blanches et lui dit :\\

Give me a reading comprehension exercise for a student learning French. It should have a subsection for answers.,"Maman ferma le livre d'histoire, le posa sur la table de chevet d'Angela et s'approcha d'elle pour lui embrasser le front.\\

-- Bonne nuit ma ch√©rie, dit-elle en la couvrant avec sa couette.\\

Angela lui souhaita bonne nuit et la regarda √©teindre la lumi√®re avant de sortir en laissant la porte entre-ouverte. Elle leva la t√™te et se mit √† admirer les √©toiles lumineuses projet√©es par sa lampe, d√©filant lentement sur le plafond de sa chambre. En les regardant, Angela se rappela d'un d√©tail tir√© de l'histoire de cette nuit : un vieux nain avait dit au prince qu'un arc-en-ciel √©tait en r√©alit√© un pont, un portail en quelque sorte, qui conduisait √† un univers merveilleux o√π on pouvait trouver tout ce que l'on d√©sire. Un monde fantastique de magie, de beaut√© et d'aventures.\\

Cette partie de l'histoire l'avait int√©ress√©e bien plus que le reste, et elle se demanda dans quel genre de monde elle atterrirait si elle venait un jour √† croiser un arc-en-ciel. Y aurait-il des dragons ? Des f√©es ? Des sir√®nes ? Angela r√™vassa un peu sur ce sujet avant de s'endormir avec un sourire r√™veur.\\

Le matin, r√©veill√©e par son alarme bruyante, elle se rappela de ses r√™ves d'aventure. Elle aurait tellement aim√© explorer de nouveaux mondes plut√¥t que d'aller en classe. Elle fit un v≈ìu de voir un arc-en-ciel, sortit de son lit et alla se pr√©parer. Une fois pr√™te, elle salua ses parents, prit son petit-d√©jeuner, et se rendit √† l'√©cole. Sa journ√©e √©tait tr√®s ordinaire, sans √©v√©nements particuliers. Elle suivit ses cours, joua avec ses amis √† la r√©cr√©ation, et prit son d√©jeuner √† la cantine.\\

√Ä l'heure de rentrer, il se mit √† pleuvoir, et Angela dut attendre car elle n'avait pas pris de parapluie. Surprise, elle se dit que c'√©tait √©trange pour une journ√©e annonc√©e ensoleill√©e. Finalement, lorsque la pluie cessa, elle se mit en route pour chez elle. En √©vitant les flaques d'eau, elle aper√ßut le reflet de quelque chose de color√© dans l'une d'elles. Elle leva la t√™te et vit un arc-en-ciel. Ses yeux s'agrandirent d'√©merveillement en se rappelant de ce qu'elle avait imagin√© la veille au soir.\\

Angela regarda autour d'elle, mais il n'y avait personne pour partager sa joie. Elle soupira, se disant qu'il aurait √©t√© merveilleux de pouvoir traverser l'arc-en-ciel pour se retrouver dans un autre monde. Distraitement, elle traversa la flaque d'eau et se sentit soudain pouss√©e par un vent violent qui la fit tomber.\\

-- Ouille ! s'√©cria-t-elle.\\

Elle ouvrit les yeux, mais resta allong√©e sur le sol, qui ne lui parut pas aussi dur qu'elle l'aurait cru. La premi√®re chose qu'elle vit √©tait un ciel bleu clair qui passait graduellement √† un rose pastel. Fron√ßant les sourcils, elle r√©alisa que le ciel √©tait diff√©rent d'il y a deux minutes ! Elle aper√ßut trois grands cercles blancs presque transparents et entendit le bruissement des feuilles, le chant des oiseaux, et le doux ruissellement de l'eau. Elle se releva et d√©couvrit avec stup√©faction qu'elle se trouvait dans une grande plaine couverte de fleurs et d'arbres, baignant dans des senteurs d'herbe et de fleurs qu'elle n'avait jamais rencontr√©es.\\

Elle remarqua qu'elle voyait, sentait et entendait tout avec une intensit√© d√©cupl√©e. Quand elle se pencha sur une petite rivi√®re pour boire, elle vit son reflet : ses cheveux avaient des reflets arc-en-ciel, et ses yeux verts brillaient d'un √©clat vif. Ses v√™tements avaient chang√© √©galement, et elle portait une tunique bleue fonc√©e, un pantalon blanc et des bottes marron.\\

Elle n'eut pas le temps de boire car son attention fut captur√©e par le reflet d'un dragon de feu volant au-dessus d'elle. Elle se tourna pour voir la cr√©ature et sentit sa chaleur passer dans l'air avec gr√¢ce.\\

-- Mais o√π suis-je ? murmura-t-elle, bouche b√©e.\\

-- Eh bien, √† Galazio, √©videmment ! r√©pondit une voix joviale.\\

Angela sursauta, cherchant autour d'elle l'origine de cette voix.\\

-- Je suis l√†, un peu plus bas ! dit la voix.\\

Elle baissa les yeux et aper√ßut une minuscule femme assise sur le p√©tale d'un coquelicot. Bien qu'elle la voyait bien, Angela s'agenouilla pour observer de plus pr√®s.\\

-- Ne viens pas trop pr√®s, ou je vais attraper froid avec tes expirations ! rit la petite femme.\\

-- Vous‚Ä¶ √™tes une f√©e ? demanda Angela en s'√©loignant.\\

-- Exactement !\\

Angela se pr√©senta et la f√©e se nomma Emmeline, ou Em pour les intimes. Elles discut√®rent, et Angela demanda s'il y avait d'autres cr√©atures magiques sur Galazio. Em lui parla des dragons, des elfes, des licornes et m√™me d'humains comme elle. Curieuse, Angela demanda si elle √©tait cens√©e combattre des cr√©atures mal√©fiques, mais Em la rassura : Galazio √©tait une plan√®te paisible.\\

-- Peut-√™tre que tu peux aller explorer des terres lointaines ? proposa Angela.\\

-- Je‚Ä¶ ne pense pas. Cette plan√®te est minuscule, r√©pondit Em avec un sourire amus√©. Mais tu peux aller √† l'√©cole !\\

Angela soupira.\\

-- Quand puis-je rentrer chez moi ? demanda-t-elle.\\

Em lui expliqua que les arcs-en-ciel, servant de portail, n'apparaissent qu'une fois tous les quinze jours. D√©√ßue, Angela soupira. Em, cherchant √† lui remonter le moral, lui proposa de faire le tour de Galazio et de se faire des amis en attendant.\\

Angela rencontra les dragons aux couleurs flamboyantes, les licornes aux crini√®res color√©es, et les autres habitants de Galazio, tous bienveillants. Elle fut invit√©e √† un grand d√Æner o√π elle d√©couvrit que tout avait un go√ªt plus prononc√© ici. Elle dansa avec les enfants de Galazio, mais se sentit soudain triste en voyant les autres rentrer avec leurs parents.\\

-- Allez, viens ! Madame Maeva t'a pr√©par√© une chambre. Au lit ! dit Em.\\

Une fois dans son lit, Angela fixa le plafond, regrettant de ne pas y voir les √©toiles de sa chambre. Elle se surprit √† souhaiter se r√©veiller chez elle. Le lendemain, elle ouvrit les yeux et poussa un soupir en se voyant encore √† Galazio. Elle rejoignit Em dans le jardin, mais un dragon de feu passa rapidement devant elle, et elle tr√©bucha.\\

-- Attention ! cria la jeune f√©e.\\

Angela entendit la voix de Mme Rolland, son institutrice, et ouvrit soudain les yeux pour d√©couvrir qu'elle √©tait dans sa classe.\\

-- Je suis de retour, chuchota-t-elle, regardant ses v√™tements d'uniforme. Quand la cloche sonna, elle courut chez elle et embrassa ses parents.\\

Il est vrai qu'il n'y avait ni dragons ni f√©es ici, mais elle √©tait chez elle, et c'√©tait tout ce qui comptait.

Give me a reading comprehension exercise for a student learning French. It should have a subsection for answers.,"Toby √©tait tr√®s excit√© d'accompagner son p√®re dehors. Les deux allaient au march√© pour acheter des l√©gumes puis au supermarch√© pour faire les courses. Malgr√© que ces t√¢ches n'avaient rien d'excitant, le petit gar√ßon √©tait heureux. C'√©tait la premi√®re fois o√π il sortait pour faire ce genre de shopping, d'habitude il sortait avec ses parents pour acheter des v√™tements ou des jouets mais jamais pour acheter de la nourriture. Il se demanda si son p√®re lui permettrait d'acheter beaucoup de g√¢teries...

Une fois qu'ils arriv√®rent au march√©, le petit gar√ßon sauta pratiquement hors de la voiture avant que son p√®re ne put quitter son si√®ge. Toby courut en avant et en se rappelant de son p√®re, il s'arr√™ta brusquement. Il se retourna et regarda son p√®re fermer la voiture avant de se tourner pour le regarder.

\textit{-Ne cours pas, mon grand. Tu risques de tomber et de te faire mal!} Son p√®re marcha vers lui et prit sa main. \textit{Et ensuite, on va se faire gronder.} Il fit un clin d'≈ìil √† son fils avec un sourire. Toby rigola joyeusement. Le prospect de se faire gronder avec son p√®re le rendit heureux et il pensa que cela le rendrait plus proche de son p√®re. Comme des camarades qui auraient d√©sob√©i aux ordres et qui se feraient r√©primander par leur sup√©rieur. Mais, sa m√®re √©tait plus belle qu'un sup√©rieur en arm√©e, bien √©videmment!

Le petit gar√ßon √©tait plein d'enthousiasme en voyant les tables pleines de fruits et l√©gumes color√©s. Des tomates rouges vif, des cerises et des poivrons. Des pommes vertes, des brocolis, des asperges. Des oranges, des citrouilles, des aubergines, des myrtilles, des pommes de terre et des melons. Il y avait tous les l√©gumes qu'il connaissait et m√™me certains qu'il ne connaissait pas.

Certaines parties du march√© √©taient m√™me d√©di√©es aux poissons, √©pices, haricots et herbes. Lui et son p√®re firent leur chemin √† travers cet endroit en achetant ce qui √©tait marqu√© dans leur liste de courses puis retourn√®rent √† la voiture et mirent leurs sacs de l√©gumes dans la malle.

Le supermarch√© √©tait beaucoup moins excitant. Les produits √©taient simplement pr√©sent√©s sur des √©tag√®res dans de diff√©rentes all√©es. Il n'y avait pas de tables avec des vendeurs qui bavardaient et riaient avec les clients mais il y avait quelques employ√©s qui offraient des √©chantillons de d√©gustation de tartelettes et de sauces au fromage et d'autres produits du genre.

Toby √©tait content d'y √™tre cependant, car son p√®re lui avait permis de choisir la marque des c√©r√©ales et lui avait m√™me achet√© une barre de chocolat comme r√©compense pour √™tre rest√© sage. Quand ils retourn√®rent √† la maison, ils pass√®rent par une vente de garage que leur voisin tenait et encore une fois, Toby √©tait intrigu√© par les gens qui s'√©taient rassembl√©s autour des tables sur lesquelles diff√©rents objets √©taient pr√©sent√©s.

Quand son p√®re expliqua qu'une vente de garage √©tait un moyen de se faire un peu d'argent et de se d√©barrasser des objets dont on n'a plus besoin, le petit gar√ßon eut une id√©e. L'apr√®s-midi, quand Toby rencontra ses amis dehors, il leur parla de son id√©e.

\textit{-On devrait tenir un march√©. On peut vendre des g√¢teries que nos mamans pr√©pareraient ou des objets que l'on n'utilise plus.}

\textit{-Quels types d'objets?} Un de ses amis lui demanda.

\textit{-Des jouets. Des livres de coloriage. N'importe quel objet que tu n'utilises plus.} Il expliqua.

\textit{-Qui les ach√®terait? Je ne crois pas que les adultes voudront des jouets et les enfants n'ont pas beaucoup d'argent. Certains n'ont m√™me pas d'argent de poche.} Une autre amie lui dit.

\textit{-On peut simplement faire des √©changes. Si l'un de vous aime quelque chose que l'autre vend, il peut √©changer avec lui un autre objet.} Toby dit ayant d√©j√† pens√© au manque d'argent.

\textit{-Les adultes n'ach√®teront peut-√™tre pas de jouets mais ils ach√®teront des biscuits et du jus. Mon grand fr√®re vendait de la limonade l'√©t√© dernier et il s'est fait assez d'argent pour acheter un nouveau t√©l√©phone.}

\textit{-Je pense que c'est une bonne id√©e. J'ai toujours voulu avoir un magasin de bouquins quand je serais grand et maintenant je peux commencer √† m'entra√Æner.} Un autre enfant dit. Les autres enfants bavard√®rent avec enthousiasme et ils √©taient tous excit√©s par leur petit projet.

\textit{-On doit demander la permission des adultes, par contre.} Toby dit. \textit{Et pas que nos parents, on doit voir si les voisins n'auront pas d'inconv√©nients.}

\textit{-Qu'est-ce qu'on va faire avec l'argent?} On lui demanda par la suite. Toby n'y avait pas pens√©. Il √©tait vrai qu'ils n'avaient besoin de rien puisque leurs parents prenaient soin de leur acheter tout ce dont ils avaient besoin et il pensa que leurs parents n'approuveraient pas qu'ils utilisent l'argent pour s'acheter des bonbons ou des jeux. Il savait que les adultes leur disaient toujours de ne pas gaspiller l'argent.

\textit{-On pourrait en faire un don aux enfants malades dans les h√¥pitaux.} L'un des gar√ßons dit en haussant les √©paules. \textit{N'est-ce pas ce que les scouts font quand ils vendent leurs biscuits? Ils font des dons et ils utilisent l'argent pour leurs programmes d'√©cole, pas vrai?} Les enfants se mirent tous d'accord sur ce point et ils pens√®rent tous que √ßa allait les aider pour convaincre leurs parents et le reste du quartier.

Les enfants se mirent d'accord et demand√®rent la permission √† leurs parents quand ils rentr√®rent chez eux. Le jour suivant, ils se divis√®rent et rendirent visite √† leurs voisins pour demander leur permission pour √©tablir leur petit march√© de quartier et personne ne protesta. Certains offrirent m√™me de pr√©parer des g√¢teries pour qu'ils les vendent.

\textit{-Mme. Jordan fait le meilleur pain aux bananes! √áa va se vendre en un rien de temps.} Toby dit avec un grand sourire. Les enfants rassembl√®rent les objets dont ils n'avaient plus besoin: des livres d'histoires, des livres de coloriage, des jouets, des affaires scolaires et m√™me des v√™tements. Certains avaient demand√© √† leurs parents de leur faire des g√¢teaux et certains pr√©par√®rent du jus tandis que d'autres pr√©par√®rent simplement des sandwiches et les voisins comme Mme. Jordan particip√®rent √©galement en pr√©parant de la nourriture ou en leur donnant des tables et des parasols pour le march√©.

Le march√© n'√©tait pas trop large, juste trois tables qui avaient √©t√© install√©es dans l'aire de jeux du quartier et les enfants en √©taient en charge. Toby √©changea sa voiture t√©l√©command√©e contre un beau T-shirt et l'une des filles acheta ses feutres en couleur. Les enfants qui vendaient de la nourriture offrirent des √©chantillons de d√©gustations et les adultes achet√®rent du jus et des g√¢teaux pour eux et leurs enfants et tout le monde s'amusa. √Ä la fin de la journ√©e, l'argent qui avait √©t√© gagn√© fut compt√© et mit dans une grande enveloppe qui avait les noms de tous les enfants qui avaient organis√© la vente √©crits sur elle et ils l'envoy√®rent au programme de charit√© pour enfants de l'h√¥pital.

Give me a reading comprehension exercise for a student learning French. It should have a subsection for answers.,"-- V-Valet ? s'√©cria Alexandre, stup√©fait par ce qu'il venait d'entendre.\\

-- C'est exact‚Ä¶ √ätes-vous s√ªr que vous vous sentez bien, messire ? demanda le monsieur en d√©posant les v√™tements sur le lit.\\

-- Je‚Ä¶ n'en sais rien, r√©pondit Alexandre en passant la main dans ses cheveux. Excusez-moi, mais quel est votre nom ?\\

-- Samuel, dit le valet avec un regard curieux. Je crois que vous feriez mieux de vous recoucher, messire. Vous n'√™tes clairement pas dans votre assiette.\\

Alexandre refusa mais lui dit qu'il pr√©f√©rerait s'habiller lui-m√™me et lui demanda de sortir de la pi√®ce. Une fois pr√©sentable, Alexandre sortit de sa chambre. Samuel l'attendait au bout du corridor et s'inclina devant lui avant de lui dire qu'il allait le conduire √† la salle √† manger pour le petit d√©jeuner. Samuel ajouta qu'ils partiraient ensuite au village pour r√©cup√©rer sa nouvelle √©p√©e chez le forgeron, et Alexandre acquies√ßa avec incertitude.\\

Au salon, il rencontra trois hommes qui se lev√®rent √† son entr√©e puis le salu√®rent. Samuel lui murmura qu'ils √©taient ses chevaliers. Surpris par l'information, Alexandre se demanda qui il √©tait dans cet univers pour vivre dans un ch√¢teau, avoir un valet, une √©p√©e et des chevaliers. Sa question trouva r√©ponse lorsqu'une des dames de cour entra et s'adressa √† lui.\\

-- Messire, son altesse votre m√®re vous informe qu'elle arrivera de son voyage √† temps pour le d√©jeuner.\\

Son altesse sa m√®re‚Ä¶ il √©tait donc un prince. Il tourna vers Samuel pour confirmer son hypoth√®se, et d'une voix basse, celui-ci lui dit :\\

-- Pas seulement un prince, messire. Vous √™tes le gardien du royaume du damier.\\

Gardien du royaume du damier‚Ä¶ Alexandre comprit que le nom du royaume venait de ses plaines, mais que voulait Samuel dire par ‚Äúgardien‚Äù ? De quoi √©tait-il cens√© garder le royaume ? Samuel interrompit ses pens√©es et lui dit qu'il √©tait temps de partir pour le village. Ensemble, les deux se dirig√®rent vers les √©curies.\\

Au d√©but, l'id√©e de monter sur un cheval rendit Alexandre anxieux. Il n'avait jamais fait quelque chose de pareil et passa quelques moments √† penser √† une bonne excuse pour √©viter l'engagement. Mais, une fois face au bel √©talon noir et apr√®s l'avoir caress√© un peu, il changea d'avis. Il monta sur son cheval et Samuel fit de m√™me avec sa jument. Ils √©chang√®rent quelques mots de temps en temps pendant qu'ils trottaient vers leur destination, et une fois arriv√©s, Samuel lui dit qu'il allait v√©rifier si l'√©p√©e √©tait pr√™te.\\

Pendant les moments qu'il passa seul, Alexandre observa autour de lui. Il vit des villageois qui marchaient un peu partout, des vendeurs de fruits et l√©gumes et divers magasins. Soudain, il entendit des cris de d√©tresse. Son cheval sursauta et faillit le faire tomber. Il se retourna pour voir d'o√π venaient les hurlements, et ses yeux s'√©largirent de surprise : des fourmis g√©antes pi√©tinaient le village.\\

Samuel, attir√© par le tumulte, sortit de l'atelier.\\

-- Messire ! cria-t-il, poussant Alexandre √† faire tourner son cheval vers lui. Tenez ! dit-il en lui lan√ßant une √©p√©e.\\

-- Mais qu'est-ce que je suis cens√© en faire ? dit Alexandre en l'attrapant maladroitement.\\

-- Utilisez-la pour chasser les fourmis ! Vous l'avez d√©j√† fait, voyons !\\

-- Je vous assure que non ! Je n'ai aucune id√©e de comment m'y prendre !\\

-- J'ai foi en vous, messire ! Bonne chance ! dit Samuel avant de se sauver avec le reste des villageois.\\

Alexandre n'eut m√™me pas le temps de r√©fl√©chir avant qu'une fourmi lui saute dessus. Par r√©flexe, il la bloqua et s'√©loigna d'elle au galop. Surpris par sa capacit√© √† brandir une √©p√©e, il la manipula et la fit tourner dans sa main un peu.\\

-- Tant pis, s'ils veulent que je sois le gardien, je vais √™tre le gardien ! se dit-il avant de retourner au champ de bataille.\\

Bien qu'il l'ait fait avec h√©sitation au d√©but, Alexandre se battit f√©rocement et courageusement. Il lan√ßa des coups d'√©p√©e et fon√ßa vers ses ennemis. Ses chevaliers ne tard√®rent pas √† le rejoindre et ensemble, ils chass√®rent les fourmis hors du royaume.\\
Les villageois sortirent de leurs abris et les acclam√®rent chaleureusement.\\

-- Vive le prince ! Vive les chevaliers ! Vive le royaume du damier ! criaient-ils avec joie.\\

De retour au ch√¢teau, les chevaliers et Samuel s'excus√®rent de la grande salle pour laisser Alexandre parler avec la reine.\\

-- Maman ! s'√©cria le gardien lorsqu'il vit enfin un visage familier.\\

Il fit quelques pas pour embrasser sa m√®re, mais son √©lan fut interrompu par une soudaine sensation de vertige. La derni√®re chose qu'il entendit avant de perdre conscience fut la voix de sa m√®re.\\

-- Alexandre, Alexandre, Alex!...\\

Lorsqu'il ouvrit les yeux de nouveau, il se trouva face √† face avec sa Maman. Elle lui caressait les cheveux et lui souriait.\\

-- Allez, debout petit paresseux. Tu ne veux plus faire de pique-nique ? lui demanda-t-elle. Papa va nous rejoindre d'un moment √† l'autre. Il m'a appel√© tout √† l'heure et m'a dit qu'il avait fini de faire les courses.\\

Alexandre prit le temps de regarder autour de lui avant de se jeter dans les bras de sa m√®re. Il √©tait de retour dans son monde. Ou plut√¥t, il s'√©tait r√©veill√© de son r√™ve.\\

-- Maman ! Tu ne vas pas croire tes oreilles lorsque je te raconte o√π j'√©tais ni ce que j'ai fait ! dit-il avec enthousiasme.\\

-- J'ai sauv√© le royaume du damier des vilaines fourmis, Maman !!!\\

La m√®re d'Alexandre rigola et lui dit qu'il pourrait tout lui raconter pendant qu'ils d√©jeuneront.

Give me a reading comprehension exercise for a student learning French. It should have a subsection for answers.,"Un bel apr√®s-midi, trois chatons jouaient pr√®s de leurs jeunes propri√©taires, qui √©coutaient une histoire que leur m√®re leur racontait. C'√©tait une histoire qui parlait des aventures d'un astronaute, et bien qu'ils ne pr√™tassent pas beaucoup d'attention √† ce qu'elle disait, leur int√©r√™t fut captur√© lorsqu'ils entendirent les mots : \textit{voie lact√©e}.\\

-- La voie lact√©e ? dit Monocle, une adorable chatonne avec un ≈ìil encercl√© de gris. Est-ce qu'elle veut dire un chemin couvert compl√®tement de lait ?\\

Oto, le plus jeune d'entre eux, se redressa en imaginant ce qu'elle venait de dire, et Farfouille, leur grand fr√®re, fixa ses yeux avec fascination.\\

-- Tu imagines si cet endroit existait vraiment ?\\

Les trois chatons furent transport√©s dans un univers fictif, o√π, dans un vaisseau spatial sombre et √©troit, le commandant Farfouille, l'officier scientifique Oto, et la m√©canicienne navigante Monocle √©taient assis l'un √† c√¥t√© de l'autre. Ils naviguaient leur navette √† travers le cosmos, s√©rieux et silencieux. Leur mission : trouver la voie lact√©e l√©gendaire et en ramener des √©chantillons ; ils n'avaient pas l'intention d'√©chouer.\\

Ils s'arr√™t√®rent pr√®s d'une station spatiale pour s'informer sur le chemin √† prendre et t√©l√©charg√®rent un guide spatial qu'ils charg√®rent dans le syst√®me de leur vaisseau. Apr√®s s'√™tre assur√©s qu'ils avaient assez de carburant et de provisions, ils reprirent leur vol. Farfouille pilota l'engin, Oto fit des recherches sur leur destination, et Monocle surveilla la condition de la navette.\\

Au bout d'un moment, elle remarqua un point clignotant sur le radar et le signala √† ses co√©quipiers.\\

-- Doit-on les attaquer, commandant ? demanda-t-elle en se tournant vers Farfouille.\\

-- Hmm... Ce sont nos ennemis jur√©s, mais ils semblent se diriger vers une autre destination. Mieux vaut nous occuper de nos propres affaires et les ignorer, r√©pondit le commandant sans quitter l'√©cran du radar des yeux.\\

-- Vous ne pensez pas qu'ils veulent go√ªter aux d√©lices de la voie lact√©e eux aussi ? demanda Oto, sa queue fr√©missante.\\

-- Non, ils visent probablement le fromage de la Lune. Ils ont des go√ªts bien excentriques, r√©pondit Farfouille.\\

-- N'oubliez pas que ces rats s'en prennent √† tout, commandant. Ils viendront probablement vers nous apr√®s leur arr√™t sur la Lune, ajouta Monocle.\\

-- Si c'est le cas, ils deviendront notre repas du soir, dit Farfouille d'un ton assur√©.\\

Oto et Monocle hoch√®rent la t√™te et se concentr√®rent sur leurs t√¢ches, tandis que le commandant continuait √† diriger le vaisseau vers la fameuse rivi√®re de lait flottante, au beau milieu de l'espace. Les trois chatons √©taient de fameux aventuriers de l'espace.\\

Farfouille, naturellement curieux et intr√©pide, aimait explorer l'univers ; Oto aimait apprendre et exp√©rimenter ; et Monocle trouvait leurs aventures amusantes et saisissait toutes les occasions de bricoler √† bord de la navette.\\

Une fois arriv√©s √† destination, les trois chatons enfil√®rent leurs combinaisons spatiales et descendirent du vaisseau. Ils flott√®rent jusqu'√† atteindre la rivi√®re de lait miraculeuse. La voie lact√©e √©tait majestueuse, son lait d'un blanc √©clatant d√©gageait une douce lueur, illuminant l'espace alentour.\\

-- Chat-pristi ! murmura Oto, √©merveill√©.\\

-- Je n'en crois pas mes yeux, c'est incroyable ! s'exclama Monocle, tout √† fait d'accord avec son fr√®re.\\

-- Si seulement on pouvait enlever nos casques ! miaula Farfouille avec regret. On aurait pu go√ªter au lait directement de la source !\\

Oto tendit la patte pour toucher le lait et constata qu'il √©tait agr√©ablement chaud.\\

-- On dit que ce lait est infus√© avec de la poussi√®re d'√©toile !\\

-- C'est donc pour √ßa qu'il brille autant !\\

-- Oui, et je pense que c'est aussi ce qui le garde √† bonne temp√©rature.\\

-- Tr√™ve de bavardage ! les interrompit Farfouille impatiemment. Sortez les aspirateurs et commen√ßons √† remplir les r√©servoirs.\\

Oto et Monocle plong√®rent de longs tubes-aspirateurs dans la rivi√®re et commenc√®rent √† pomper le lait vers les r√©servoirs de leur navette spatiale, tandis que Farfouille surveillait les niveaux. Soudain, Monocle aper√ßut un √©trange signal sur son radar portable.\\

-- On dirait qu'un vaisseau s'approche √† toute vitesse !\\

-- Restez ici, je vais v√©rifier sur le radar de bord. Je suis s√ªr que ce n'est rien, dit Farfouille.\\

Quelques instants plus tard, il ordonna √† Oto et Monocle de retourner √† bord du vaisseau.\\

-- C'est la navette des rats, ils viennent nous attaquer !\\

Lorsque les rongeurs approch√®rent, Farfouille visa et commen√ßa √† tirer sur eux avec les armes laser de la navette.\\

-- Monocle, t√¢che d'esquiver leurs attaques pendant qu'Oto et moi ripostons, ordonna Farfouille.\\

Comment osaient ces vermines les attaquer, et pr√®s de la voie lact√©e sacr√©e en plus ! Il n'√©tait pas question de les laisser contaminer cette rivi√®re de lait l√©gendaire.\\

Apr√®s une longue bataille, les rats battirent en retraite, et la voie lact√©e fut sauv√©e par les courageux chatons de l'espace.\\

-- Mais qu'est-ce qu'ils font ? demanda une voix.\\

Les chatons relev√®rent la t√™te et virent leurs jeunes propri√©taires les regarder avec confusion. Monocle sortit de la bo√Æte en carton o√π ils jouaient et se dirigea vers sa jeune humaine. Farfouille et Oto firent de m√™me, et les trois chatons ronronn√®rent sous les caresses affectueuses de leurs amis humains.\\

-- Allez, rentrons ! Je suis s√ªre qu'ils ont faim, donnons-leur un peu de lait, dit l'humaine de Monocle √† ses fr√®res.

Give me a reading comprehension exercise for a student learning French. It should have a subsection for answers.,"Marty √©tait tr√®s content de passer la journ√©e chez son ami. Les deux enfants pass√®rent la matin√©e √† jouer au football dans le jardin et pass√®rent m√™me un peu de temps avec le chien avant de rentrer dans la maison pour d√©jeuner. \\

Quand ils all√®rent √† l'√©tage dans la chambre de son ami pour passer le reste de la journ√©e √† jouer aux jeux vid√©os, un petit carnet attira l'attention de Marty. \\

\textit{-C'est quoi √ßa, sur ton bureau ?} demanda-t-il en regardant l'objet. \\

\textit{-Oh ! C'est une collection de timbres,} son ami r√©pondit. \textit{Mon p√®re re√ßoit des lettres de partout dans le monde de ses correspondants. Je ne sais pas pourquoi ils n'utilisent pas simplement le t√©l√©phone ou les e-mails, mais √† chaque fois qu'il re√ßoit une lettre, il me laisse prendre le timbre de l'enveloppe. Je les trouve tr√®s cool et donc j'ai commenc√© √† les collectionner il y a environ un an. Jettes-y un coup d'≈ìil si tu veux !} \\

Marty, intrigu√© par le concept de collectionner des petits morceaux de papier, accepta l'offre de son ami et commen√ßa √† feuilleter les pages du carnet. \\

Il regarda les timbres avec fascination. Quelques-uns avaient des images de personnes sur eux, d'autres avaient des paysages tandis que certains avaient des machines, des trains et des animaux. \\

Il avait aim√© les couleurs des timbres, mais ce qui l'int√©ressa le plus √©tait la collection en elle-m√™me. Les seules choses qu'il avait collectionn√©es dans sa vie √©taient des armures dans un jeu et malgr√© qu'il s'en √©tait vant√© devant ses amis, il ne pensait pas que c'√©tait aussi int√©ressant que la collection de timbres de son ami, qui resta dans sa t√™te jusqu'√† ce qu'il rentre chez lui. \\

En r√©alit√©, il avait vraiment envie de commencer une collection √† lui. Mais... que pouvait-il collectionner ? √Ä ce qu'il savait, aucun de ses parents n'avaient de correspondants √©trangers qui leur envoyaient des lettres et donc, il ne pouvait pas collectionner des timbres. \\

Il supposa qu'il pouvait collectionner ce qu'il voulait et c'√©tait bien √ßa le probl√®me, il n'avait aucune id√©e sur quoi choisir ! \\

Il s'installa devant son ordinateur et chercha quelques id√©es en ligne. \\

Certaines personnes collectionnaient des fleurs s√©ch√©es, apparemment, ce qui ne l'int√©ressa pas vraiment car les seules fleurs qu'il y avait dans le jardin de sa maison √©taient des roses. \\

Il trouva aussi des gens qui collectionnaient des pi√®ces de monnaie provenant de diff√©rents pays, c'√©tait int√©ressant mais il ne voyageait pas et donc cette option avait √©t√© abandonn√©e. \\

Certaines personnes collectionnaient des bandes dessin√©es et il pensa qu'il pr√©f√©rait regarder des dessins anim√©s au lieu de lire des bandes dessin√©es et les acheter rien que pour les collectionner √©tait du g√¢chis. \\

L'un des objets collectionn√©s les plus bizarres qu'il trouva √©taient des papillons. \\

\textit{-Argh, c'est tellement flippant...} murmura-t-il √† lui-m√™me. \\

Il ne savait pas vraiment pourquoi les gens voudraient garder des cadavres de papillons chez eux, mais en y pensant, les collections de fleurs s√©ch√©es √©taient presque la m√™me chose. \\

Il vit aussi qu'il √©tait possible de collectionner des pierres min√©rales et des cristaux mais il n'√©tait pas vraiment int√©ress√© par ce type d'objets et il ne voulait pas aller en randonn√©e pour les trouver. \\

L'une des choses les plus int√©ressantes que les gens collectionnaient √©taient les m√©dailles et il trouva √ßa tr√®s cool, il les collectionnerait peut-√™tre une fois que son √©quipe de foot √† l'√©cole commencerait les comp√©titions. \\

Pour l'instant, il allait continuer √† chercher. \\

Dans un article, il lut qu'on pouvait collectionner n'importe quoi, du moment que c'est quelque chose que l'on aime et qu'il n'y avait pas de r√®gles. \\

Les gens collectionnaient des trucs qu'ils aimaient et qui les amusaient. \\

Il passa quelques instants √† penser √† ce qu'il aimait le plus et les seules choses auxquelles il pouvait penser √©taient les jeux vid√©os, le football, le chocolat et le skating. \\

Il ne pouvait pas exactement collectionner les jeux vu qu'il les t√©l√©chargeait en ligne et le foot √©tait un sport, pas quelque chose que l'on collectionne ! \\

Mais... il pouvait collectionner des ballons. \\

\textit{-Trop grands...} il se dit en secouant la t√™te. \\

Il n'avait pas assez d'espace dans sa chambre o√π il pourrait les garder. \\

La m√™me chose s'appliquait pour les skateboards. \\

Et ils √©taient trop chers en plus. \\

La seule chose qui restait √©tait le chocolat. \\

Marty fron√ßa les sourcils, √ßa serait vraiment du g√¢chis d'acheter des friandises juste pour les mettre dans une bo√Æte, alors l√† le chocolat. \\

Et, pour √™tre honn√™te, il ne se faisait pas confiance pour ne pas les manger imm√©diatement apr√®s les avoir achet√©es. \\

C'√©tait juste trop bon ! \\

Par contre, le chocolat √©tait tr√®s vari√© et avait beaucoup de formes et de parfums, les vari√©t√©s √©taient presque infinies ! \\

Et donc, √ßa serait quelque chose d'int√©ressant √† collectionner. \\

Humm, que faire ? Il eut soudainement une id√©e qui pourrait r√©gler ses probl√®mes. \\

Il pourrait simplement collectionner les emballages ! Oui, tous les types de chocolat √©taient emball√©s ou dans une bo√Æte. \\

Comme √ßa il pourrait manger le chocolat et collectionner les emballages. \\

Tout le monde gagne ! \\

\textit{-Je suis un g√©nie !} il pensa avec fiert√©. \\

Il ouvrit un tiroir et y fouilla pour un moment avant d'en sortir une barre de chocolat qu'il y avait gard√©e. \\

\textit{-√áa va √™tre le premier √©l√©ment de ma collection,} dit-il avant d'aller sur son bureau et de prendre un carnet neuf. \\

\textit{-Je vais coller les emballages ici.} \\

Il avait pens√© que l'id√©e de son ami de garder les timbres dans un carnet √©tait intelligente et il voulait faire la m√™me chose. \\

Il pr√©para du ruban adh√©sif et un feutre pour noter la date du jour et √©crire une petite note et il d√©balla la barre de chocolat. \\

Il savoura son go√ªt sucr√© et une fois qu'il en avait fini, il utilisa une lingette pour nettoyer les quelques endroits o√π il y avait du chocolat fondu coll√© √† l'int√©rieur de l'emballage. \\

Une fois que le tout avait s√©ch√©, il √©tendit l'emballage et le mit sur une page du carnet avant de l'y fixer avec du ruban adh√©sif. \\

Il √©crivit avec son feutre sur la page sous l'emballage et ferma le carnet avec un sourire satisfait. \\

Il resta en place pour un moment avant de courir hors de sa chambre pour parler √† ses parents de son nouveau loisir. \\

Apr√®s tout, il avait besoin de leur soutien pour acheter le chocolat et √©tendre sa collection ! \\

Ses parents √©taient amus√©s et apr√®s qu'il eut promis d'√™tre responsable et de ne pas manger trop de chocolat, ils approuv√®rent.

Give me a reading comprehension exercise for a student learning French. It should have a subsection for answers.,"\textit{-N'oublie pas ton parapluie, ma ch√©rie. La m√©t√©o a annonc√© qu'il allait peut-√™tre pleuvoir aujourd'hui aussi,} Madame Sanders dit √† sa fille depuis la cuisine en l'entendant ouvrir la porte. \\

\textit{-Oui, maman !} Amy r√©pondit en prenant son parapluie du porte-manteau o√π il √©tait pos√©. \\

La fillette mit ses bras dans les bretelles de son cartable et arrangea son bonnet en laine avant de quitter la maison. \\

En route vers l'√©cole, elle chantonna doucement en sautant au-del√† des flaques d'eau produites par la pluie de la nuit pass√©e. \\

Elle regarda le ciel et vit les nuages gris qui indiquaient que sa m√®re avait raison de pr√™ter tant d'attention √† la m√©t√©o. \\

Si les nuages dans le ciel indiquaient quoi que ce soit, c'√©tait qu'il allait pleuvoir √† travers la journ√©e. \\

Amy commen√ßa √† balancer son parapluie en pensant aux pr√©sentateurs de la m√©t√©o. \\

Est-ce qu'ils devaient voyager partout √† travers le monde pour voir quel temps il allait faire l√†-bas ? \\

Si c'√©tait le cas, la petite fille pensa que c'√©tait le travail le plus cool au monde. \\

Comme √ßa devait √™tre super de voyager partout juste pour voir le ciel et de dire aux gens de ne pas oublier de mettre leurs manteaux ou d'annuler leurs plans de pique-nique ! \\

Ou bien, peut-√™tre qu'ils allaient dans l'espace pour faire leur travail ? \\

C'√©tait logique, vu qu'ils seraient plus capables de voir comment les nuages bougeaient d'en haut, n'est-ce pas ? \\

√áa aussi c'√©tait tr√®s cool, par contre ! \\

Le fait de porter ces combinaisons d'espace et de monter sur une navette spatiale serait g√©nial ! \\

Ou bien... est-ce qu'ils communiquaient simplement avec les extraterrestres qui leur disaient comment les choses allaient progresser sur terre ?! \\

Amy s'arr√™ta de marcher et laissa √©chapper un souffle en pensant √† √ßa. \\

Si c'√©tait le cas, alors les extraterrestres existent vraiment ! \\

Elle vit un groupe d'oiseaux voler loin de la ville et se souvint que leur enseignant leur avait dit une fois qu'ils migraient vers des r√©gions plus chaudes. \\

Mais comment savaient-ils quand il allait faire plus froid ? \\

Avaient-ils des diffusions de m√©t√©o aussi ? \\

Elle rigola et reprit son chemin. \\

Cette pens√©e √©tait ridicule ! \\

Mais elle √©tait tr√®s curieuse sur comment un pr√©sentateur de m√©t√©o faisait son travail et elle d√©cida de poser la question √† son enseignant avant la r√©cr√©ation. \\

Une fois arriv√©e en classe, Amy compta les minutes avec impatience, ayant h√¢te de poser ses questions et de r√©soudre le myst√®re qu'elle avait en t√™te depuis ce matin. \\

Quand la cloche sonna enfin, elle se dirigea rapidement vers le bureau de l'enseignant et demanda quelques moments de son temps. \\

\textit{-Comment savent les pr√©sentateurs de la m√©t√©o quand et o√π il va pleuvoir et quand il va faire beau et tout ?} demanda-t-elle quand il lui pr√™ta son attention. \\

\textit{-Et bien, tout d'abord, tu dois conna√Ætre la diff√©rence entre un pr√©sentateur de m√©t√©o et un m√©t√©orologiste,} son enseignant lui dit avant de commencer son explication. \\

\textit{Les pr√©sentateurs de m√©t√©o sont des gens qui pr√©sentent la m√©t√©o √† la t√©l√©vision. Ils re√ßoivent des rapports et les lisent en indiquant des endroits du pays sur l'√©cran. Les m√©t√©orologistes sont les gens qui pr√©parent ces rapports. Ce sont des savants qui √©tudient le climat et la m√©t√©o et font des pr√©dictions sur quel temps il va faire au futur.} \\

Amy hocha la t√™te, int√©ress√©e. \\

\textit{-Et, comment font-ils ces pr√©dictions ?} \\

\textit{-Ils utilisent des informations sur l'√©tat de la m√©t√©o au pass√© et mesurent son √©tat actuel au pr√©sent et ils devinent son √©tat au futur en se basant sur √ßa.} \\

Amy fron√ßa ses sourcils, son enseignant n'avait pas vraiment tout expliqu√©. \\

\textit{-D'accord, mais comment est-ce qu'ils obtiennent les informations dont ils ont besoin ? Est-ce qu'il leur suffit de regarder le ciel ou...?} \\

\textit{-Oh ! Ils utilisent des outils comme des thermom√®tres pour mesurer la temp√©rature, des barom√®tres pour mesurer la pression de l'air et des an√©mom√®tres pour mesurer la vitesse du vent.} \\

\textit{Ils utilisent aussi des images prises √† partir de satellites pour observer la distribution des nuages dans le ciel.} \\

\textit{Quand ils ont les donn√©es n√©cessaires, ils les introduisent dans des ordinateurs qui utilisent des √©quations sp√©ciales pour faire des calculs qui produisent par la suite des mod√®les qui les aident √† pr√©dire la m√©t√©o.} \\

\textit{Ces mod√®les ne sont pas toujours pr√©cis par contre et les savants doivent les r√©viser pour voir s'ils sont coh√©rents ou pas.} \\

\textit{Il est tr√®s important que la m√©t√©o soit aussi pr√©cise que possible parce que non seulement elle nous dit quand il va pleuvoir pour qu'on √©vite d'√™tre tremp√©s, elle nous pr√©vient aussi quand il va y avoir de dangereux ph√©nom√®nes comme des ouragans et elle nous aide √† rester en s√©curit√©.} \\

\textit{Les fermiers, les marins et les pilotes comptent beaucoup sur la m√©t√©o dans leur travail et m√™me les sportifs.} \\

Les yeux d'Amy s'√©largirent par confusion. \\

\textit{-Comment est-ce que la m√©t√©o peut affecter le travail de ces gens ?} \\

\textit{-Et bien, les fermiers ont besoin de savoir s'il va pleuvoir pour planter les graines appropri√©es.} \\

\textit{Quelques plantes grandissent dans des environnements pluviaux et d'autres ne peuvent pas survivre si le temps est trop humide.} \\

\textit{Les marins ont besoin de savoir s'il va y avoir des temp√™tes pour prendre leurs pr√©cautions et rester en s√©curit√© √† la mer.} \\

\textit{Et c'est la m√™me chose pour les pilotes, ils ne peuvent pas faire voler des avions dans des conditions m√©t√©orologiques difficiles et les sportifs ne peuvent pas jouer comme il le faut sous la pluie.} \\

\textit{Tu imagines ce que √ßa ferait de jouer dans un terrain glissant ?} \\

Amy rigola en imaginant les grands joueurs de football am√©ricain que son p√®re aimait regarder glisser dans la boue en courant √† travers le terrain. \\

Elle n'aimerait pas √™tre √† leur place ! \\

Et rien qu'en pensant au mal de mer et √† la naus√©e qu'on peut avoir en √©tant dans un bateau qui bascule la fit faire une grimace. \\

Elle n'avait jamais vraiment r√©alis√© √† quel point la m√©t√©o √©tait importante et malgr√© qu'elle √©tait un peu d√©√ßue par le fait que ni les pr√©sentateurs ni les m√©t√©orologistes ne voyageaient ni n'allaient dans l'espace pour faire leurs recherches, elle pensait quand m√™me que c'√©tait un m√©tier tr√®s int√©ressant. \\

Tellement int√©ressant, d'ailleurs, qu'elle voulut en savoir plus et il n'y avait pas de meilleur endroit pour commencer que la biblioth√®que. \\

\textit{-Merci beaucoup pour vos explications, Monsieur Brown !} dit-elle avec enthousiasme avant de prendre sa carte de biblioth√®que et de courir hors de la salle de classe. \\

Elle avait juste assez de temps pour obtenir quelques livres avant la fin de la r√©cr√©ation !

Give me a word problem for a 6th grade student learning mathematics. It should have a subsection for answers.,"Jason sold \(\frac{3}{10}\) as many pens as Mike. If Jason sold 210 fewer pens than Mike, how many pens did they sell altogether?

\subsection*{Answers}
Let \( x \) be the number of pens Mike sold. Then, Jason sold \(\frac{3}{10}x\) pens. According to the problem, we have the equation:

\[
\frac{3}{10}x = x - 210
\]

Solving for \( x \):

\[
\frac{3}{10}x + 210 = x
\]
\[
210 = x - \frac{3}{10}x
\]
\[
210 = \frac{7}{10}x
\]
\[
x = 210 \times \frac{10}{7} = 300
\]

So, Mike sold 300 pens, and Jason sold:

\[
\frac{3}{10} \times 300 = 90
\]

Altogether, they sold:

\[
300 + 90 = 390 \text{ pens.}

Give me a reading comprehension exercise for a student learning French. It should have a subsection for answers.,"Un matin, alors qu'il √©tait assis devant la fen√™tre, le visage crisp√©, Lucien l√¢cha un soupir en voyant le temps qu'il faisait.\\
Cela allait faire bient√¥t une semaine qu'il pleuvait √† torrents et √ßa l'aga√ßait √©norm√©ment.\\
Il tourna vers ses camarades de garderie et les regarda avec curiosit√©. Comment pouvaient-ils continuer √† jouer avec une telle indiff√©rence ?\\
C'est comme s'ils s'√©taient r√©sign√©s √† l'ennui, un truc qu'il ne pouvait accomplir.\\
Il jeta un dernier regard hors de la fen√™tre, √† l'aire de jeux qui se tenait sous la pluie, et haussa les √©paules.\\
Tant pis, il n'aura qu'√† penser √† autre chose pour faire passer le temps.\\

Il regarda autour de lui et vit Damien qui jouait avec les petits soldats.\\
Il se dirigea vers lui et lui tapota l'√©paule. Une fois qu'il eut son attention, il lui dit qu'il en avait assez de rester √† l'int√©rieur sans rien faire d'amusant.\\

-- On peut jouer √† cache-cache avec les autres, si tu veux ? sugg√©ra Damien.\\

Lucien n'√©tait pas vraiment int√©ress√© au vieux jeu. Il voulait vivre une aventure, sentir la joie et l'excitation de l'inconnu.\\

-- Non‚Ä¶\\

Il prit une pause, r√©fl√©chit un moment puis dit √† Damien :\\

-- J'ai une meilleure id√©e. Aide-moi √† rassembler les autres.\\

Lorsque tout le monde fut r√©uni, Lucien leur demanda de s'asseoir en cercle puis commen√ßa √† parler avec un ton s√©rieux.\\

-- On va jouer au village maudit, leur annon√ßa-t-il.\\
Il s'agit d'un village envahi par les ogres et les sorci√®res.\\
Les villageois doivent se cacher et √©viter de se faire attraper par les ogres pour enfin aller au ch√¢teau et alerter les soldats et sauver le village,\\
expliqua Lucien en montrant les soldats que Damien avait align√©s.\\
-- Ils doivent souvent changer de cachette car les ogres peuvent les renifler s'ils restent dans le m√™me endroit trop longtemps.\\
Et quoi qu'il arrive, ils ne doivent jamais laisser une sorci√®re leur mettre la main dessus.\\

Il d√©signa √† chacun son r√¥le.\\

-- Pierre, √âlo√Øse et Manon sont les ogres.\\

-- H√© ! Mais je ne veux pas √™tre une ogresse ! protesta Manon.\\

-- C'est comme √ßa. Tu seras la princesse dans la prochaine partie, lui dit Lucien.\\

La fillette, √©tant la plus jeune du groupe et donc la plus na√Øve, ne s'√©tait pas rendu compte qu'il n'y avait pas de princesse dans le jeu, et se contenta de jouer le r√¥le de l'ogresse pour le moment,\\
permettant √† Lucien de continuer.\\

-- Damien, moi et Sabine sommes les villageois.\\

Sabine, confuse par l'affectation des r√¥les, lui demanda qui joueront les r√¥les des sorci√®res puisque tout le monde avait d√©j√† un r√¥le.\\
Lucien se pencha vers le groupe d'enfants et dit d'une voix basse et mena√ßante :\\

-- Les sorci√®res‚Ä¶ c'est les aides maternelles !\\

Le groupe laissa √©chapper quelques exclamations et cris de surprise avant de se lever et partir assumer leurs positions.\\

Les ogres dormirent pendant que les villageois all√®rent se cacher.\\
Lucien se plongea dans le monde qu'il venait de cr√©er.\\

D√©sormais, sa cr√®che ressemblait aux bois m√©di√©vaux qu'on trouve dans les contes de f√©es et lui-m√™me se voyait v√™tu d'un pantalon moulant marron, d'une cotte-hardie verte et chauss√© d'une paire de bottes us√©es.\\
Il courut, essouffl√©, et se cacha derri√®re un arbre.\\
Il jeta un coup d'≈ìil furtif pour voir si les ogres s'√©taient r√©veill√©s et vit qu'en effet, ils l'√©taient.\\
Il les guetta et les vit en train de marcher dans diff√©rentes directions, s'arr√™tant pour chercher derri√®re des arbres ou √† l'int√©rieur des grottes.\\

√Ä un moment, lorsqu'il vit que les ogres lui tournaient le dos, il fila √† toute vitesse pour changer d'abri.\\
Son c≈ìur battait la chamade et il √©tait tremp√© de sueur lorsqu'il s'accroupit derri√®re un buisson.\\
Il √©carta son feuillage et vit Damien qui essayait de se faufiler derri√®re les grandes b√™tes, mais par malchance,\\
celui-ci ne vit pas la pi√®ce de Lego--plut√¥t la branche qui √©tait sur son chemin et marcha dessus, alertant les ogres de sa pr√©sence.\\

Lucien, souhaitant sauver son ami, prit une des baies du buisson et la jeta sur l'ogre le plus proche de Damien, d√©tournant son attention et permettant √† l'autre villageois de s'enfuir √† temps.\\
Lucien profita de la confusion pour changer, lui aussi, de cachette.\\
Il grimpa sur un arbre et regarda du haut de son perchoir pour voir comment les autres s'en sortaient.\\

Damien se tenait debout derri√®re un arbre, inaper√ßu par les ogres, et Sabine tentait de changer de cachette mais sans succ√®s.\\
Lorsqu'elle se jeta enfin dans la gueule du loup, la plus jeune ogresse lui mit la main dessus.\\

Navr√© par le sort de sa voisine, Lucien secoua la t√™te avant de se rappeler qu'il devait changer de cachette avant qu'il ne se fasse rep√©rer.\\
En se dirigeant vers un autre arbre, il vit du coin de l'≈ìil que Damien aussi s'√©tait fait capturer.\\

Malgr√© sa tristesse, il savait qu'il devait continuer, ne serait-ce que pour sauver le village. Trois contre un, ses chances de survie √©taient minces, mais il refusait de renoncer √† sa qu√™te.\\

Il respira profond√©ment avant de foncer vers les soldats.\\
Il √©tait si proche ! Il allait y arriver ! Ses jambes ne le tenaient plus, ses poumons br√ªlaient et le vent soufflait contre lui mais rien ne l'arr√™ta.\\

√Ä deux pas des soldats, il heurta un grand mur qui apparut de nulle part.\\
L'impact le lan√ßa √† terre et il entendit Sabine s'exclamer :\\

-- Non ! La sorci√®re l'a eu !\\

Expuls√© de son monde fantastique, Lucien fit un petit sourire penaud √† son institutrice avant de s'excuser.\\

-- Ce n'est pas grave, dit-elle avec un sourire.\\
-- Je suis venue vous chercher pour le d√©jeuner.\\
Il y a une soupe de citrouille dans le chaudron qui n'attend que vous !\\

Give me a reading comprehension exercise for a student learning French. It should have a subsection for answers.,"Sous le soleil brillant de l'√©t√©, deux filles jouaient joyeusement ensemble √† la marelle. Charlotte et Ines √©taient meilleures amies. Elles √©taient ins√©parables et se sentaient chanceuses d'√™tre dans la m√™me classe et d'habiter dans le m√™me quartier. Elles se connaissaient depuis leurs jours pass√©s dans le bac √† sable et s'imaginaient qu'elles resteraient meilleures amies jusqu'√† la mort. Les deux filles s'aimaient beaucoup et √©taient proches comme des s≈ìurs.\\

Ce matin, Ines avait ramen√© de la craie et propos√© √† sa copine de jouer au fameux jeu. Charlotte accepta avec enthousiasme et se mit √† chercher un caillou pendant qu'Ines tra√ßait le plateau de jeu. Une fois que tout √©tait pr√™t, leur partie commen√ßa. Ines jeta le caillou sur la premi√®re case et commen√ßa √† faire le parcours √† cloche-pied. Lorsqu'elle fit son retour et tenta de lancer le caillou sur la deuxi√®me case, celui-ci atterrit sur la troisi√®me, et elle passa son tour.\\

Un peu plus tard, quand Ines prit de nouveau son tour, Charlotte interrompit son parcours en lui disant qu'elle avait march√© sur le trait.\\

-- Mais non, j'√©tais assez loin des bords de la case, protesta Ines.\\

-- Mais si, tu ne l'as peut-√™tre pas vu toi-m√™me, mais d'o√π je suis, c'√©tait clair que tu avais march√© dessus ! insista Charlotte.\\

-- Tu es s√ªre que tu ne dis pas √ßa juste pour avoir ton tour ? dit Ines, plissant les yeux avec suspicion.\\

-- Bien s√ªr que non, comment peux-tu dire √ßa ! r√©pondit Charlotte en fron√ßant les sourcils.\\

Leur discussion se transforma vite en conflit, et les deux filles finirent par se disputer. Par ent√™tement, aucune d'elles ne quitta l'aire de jeux ni ne continua √† jouer. Elles s'assirent, le dos tourn√© l'une vers l'autre, boudant en silence, jusqu'√† ce qu'une vieille dame v√Ænt les saluer.\\

-- Bonjour Ines, bonjour Charlotte. Comment allez-vous, mes petites ?\\

-- Bonjour, Madame Morel, dirent-elles en m√™me temps, ajoutant qu'elles allaient bien avant de lui demander de ses nouvelles.\\

-- Je vais bien, merci, sourit Mme Morel gentiment. J'√©tais en train de ranger mon grenier, et je me demandais si vous voudriez bien me donner un coup de main. Peut-√™tre y trouverez-vous quelque chose qui vous plairait, m√™me si √ßa date de plusieurs d√©cennies.\\

Bien qu'elles ne se parlent pas, et malgr√© leur mauvaise humeur, les deux filles √©taient trop polies pour refuser d'aider leur vieille voisine et accept√®rent de l'aider.\\

-- Excellent, je vous remercie ! Je vais passer un coup de fil √† vos m√®res pour les informer que vous √™tes chez moi, dit Mme Morel, leur promettant aussi des brownies en r√©compense.\\

Une fois chez la vieille dame, les deux filles commenc√®rent √† trier les objets du grenier, mettant d'un c√¥t√© ce qui devait √™tre jet√© et de l'autre ce qui pourrait encore servir. Elles ne savaient pas si Mme Morel voulait garder, donner, ou vendre ces objets, alors elles pr√©f√©raient la laisser d√©cider. Pendant une demi-heure, elles ne se dirent pas un mot, jusqu'√† ce que Mme Morel v√Ænt v√©rifier si tout allait bien.\\

-- Faites attention ! Aidez-vous pour soulever les objets lourds, sinon vous risquez de vous blesser, leur dit-elle avant de les rejoindre dans le m√©nage du grenier.\\

Avec leur vieille voisine dans la pi√®ce, les deux filles commenc√®rent √† se parler, ne serait-ce que pour demander de l'aide de temps en temps. Quelques instants plus tard, Mme Morel les appela pour voir le contenu d'une bo√Æte en carton.\\

-- Ce sont vos jouets ? demanda Charlotte en saisissant une petite poup√©e.\\

-- Certains, oui. D'autres √©taient ceux de mes enfants, r√©pondit Mme Morel avec un sourire nostalgique. √áa, par exemple, dit-elle en leur montrant un gros ressort color√©, appartenait √† ma fille a√Æn√©e, Marie.\\

Elle tendit le ressort √† Ines, qui le regarda avec fascination avant de le passer √† son amie.\\

-- Et ce jeu de dominos appartenait √† mon plus jeune fils, ajouta-t-elle en sortant une petite bo√Æte en bois.\\

-- Et √ßa ? dit Charlotte en pointant un petit livret du doigt.\\

-- Ah ! s'exclama Mme Morel avec joie en sortant le livret de la bo√Æte. C'est un album photo rempli de souvenirs avec ma meilleure amie.\\

Mme Morel ouvrit le petit album et leur montra des photos d'elle et de son amie d'enfance, capturant des moments de leur enfance jusqu'√† l'adolescence.\\

-- Vous aviez l'air tellement heureuses ! s'exclama Ines, trouvant les sourires des deux filles dans les photos contagieux.\\

-- On l'√©tait, dit la vieille dame doucement. On √©tait aussi proches que vous l'√™tes aujourd'hui.\\

Charlotte, remarquant que Mme Morel avait conjugu√© son verbe au pass√©, lui demanda si elles avaient perdu contact.\\

-- Non, nous sommes rest√©es meilleures amies jusqu'√† la fin. L'an dernier, mon amie est d√©c√©d√©e.\\

-- Oh‚Ä¶\\

Charlotte se sentit coupable d'avoir rappel√© quelque chose de triste √† Mme Morel et baissa les yeux.\\

-- Je suis d√©sol√©e, dit-elle.\\

-- Ce n'est pas ta faute, ma ch√©rie. Et puis, nous avons eu toute notre vie pour nous aimer et nous amuser, dit la vieille dame en prenant les deux filles dans ses bras. Maintenant, c'est √† votre tour de vous faire de bons souvenirs.\\

Ines et Charlotte se regard√®rent timidement, un peu embarrass√©es par leur dispute, et √©chang√®rent un sourire. Petit √† petit, elles recommenc√®rent √† se parler comme les meilleures amies qu'elles √©taient.\\

-- Regarde √ßa ! dit Ines √† sa copine en lui montrant une paire de raquettes de plage.\\

-- Oh ! Tu crois que Mme Morel nous laissera les garder ?\\

La dame en personne les rejoignit avec un plateau contenant deux grands verres de lait et une assiette remplie de brownies.\\

Give me a reading comprehension exercise for a student learning French. It should have a subsection for answers.,"St√©phanie fit tambouriner ses doigts sur son bureau, les yeux fix√©s sur la feuille blanche qui √©tait pos√©e au centre avec un stylo au-dessus. \\
\textit{-Mais qu'est-ce que je dois choisir ?} se demanda-t-elle en se penchant en arri√®re sur sa chaise avec un soupir. \\
Elle devait √©crire un texte dans lequel elle d√©crit sa saison pr√©f√©r√©e et explique pourquoi elle l'aime tellement. C'√©tait un devoir que leur enseignant leur avait demand√© de faire et de rendre le lendemain. \\
Pour St√©fy, les expressions √©crites √©taient faciles et amusantes √† faire, d'ailleurs c'√©tait une des rares choses qu'elle aimait avoir comme devoir. \\
Le seul probl√®me √©tait qu'elle ne savait pas quoi choisir, elle aimait toutes les saisons et n'avait pas une qu'elle pr√©f√©rait. N'√©tait-ce pas le but d'avoir quatre saisons en rotation, apr√®s tout, d'avoir l'occasion et le plaisir de les vivre toutes ? \\

Elle aimait la progression naturelle des saisons, elle aimait le froid et la pluie de l'hiver, les couleurs du printemps, la joie de l'√©t√© et la douceur de l'automne. \\
Apr√®s quelques moments de r√©flexion, elle d√©cida de demander √† ses parents quelle √©tait leur saison pr√©f√©r√©e en esp√©rant que √ßa l'aiderait √† d√©cider. \\
Papa avait dit qu'il aimait l'hiver et lorsque St√©fy lui avait demand√© pourquoi pas les autres saisons, il avait dit que son allergie au pollen rendait le printemps p√©nible, qu'il y avait trop de mouches en automne et qu'il faisait trop chaud pendant l'√©t√©.\\
Maman avait choisi l'√©t√© simplement parce qu'elle pouvait faire la grasse matin√©e et ne devait pas se lever t√¥t pour pr√©parer le petit d√©jeuner et conduire sa fille √† l'√©cole. \\

Pas vraiment convaincue par les raisons de ses parents, qui semblaient √™tre plus pratiques qu'amusantes, St√©phanie alla parler avec ses amis. \\
Tous sauf un lui avaient dit qu'ils pr√©f√©raient l'√©t√© parce que c'est la saison des vacances et qu'ils pouvaient jouer √† volont√©, n'avaient pas de devoirs, et en plus ils pouvaient aller √† la plage. \\
Le dernier lui avait dit qu'il aimait l'automne parce qu'il aimait voir les feuilles des arbres changer de couleur et le vol des oiseaux qui partent en migration vers des r√©gions plus chaudes. \\
Lorsqu'il lui demanda pourquoi elle voulait savoir, elle lui expliqua son probl√®me. \\

\begin{quote}
\textit{-Je vois, alors ton souci c'est que tu ne peux pas faire un choix, c'est √ßa ?}\\
\textit{-Oui.}\\
\textit{-Alors, pourquoi n'√©cris-tu pas un texte qui contient toutes les saisons ? Une saison quatre-en-un en quelque sorte,} sugg√©ra-t-il.
\end{quote}

St√©phanie tapota son doigt sur son menton et prit quelques instants pour penser √† l'id√©e de son ami. \\
Ce n'√©tait pas mal comme suggestion et l'enseignant n'avait pas pr√©cis√© de r√®gles qui pouvaient l'emp√™cher de le faire. Et puis, plus elle y pensait, plus elle avait envie de le faire, elle trouvait √ßa amusant d'imaginer une saison qui regroupe les quatre qui existent. \\
Elle remercia son ami puis rentra chez elle pour commencer son travail. \\

Elle s'assied sur sa chaise de bureau, ferma les yeux et commen√ßa √† imaginer son monde o√π les saisons √©taient fusionn√©es en une seule. \\
Elle imagina une belle for√™t o√π les arbres avaient un feuillage tant√¥t vert de printemps, tant√¥t dor√© d'automne, certains arbres √©taient recouverts de neige et d'autres portaient des fruits m√ªrs. \\
On y entendait le chant des oiseaux et des criquets, et on pouvait voir des abeilles et des papillons butiner les fleurs et les baies sur les buissons. Il ne faisait ni trop froid, ni trop chaud.\\

St√©phanie ouvrit soudainement les yeux et secoua la t√™te. \\
\begin{quote}
\textit{-Non, ce n'est pas vraiment excitant de m√©langer le tout‚Ä¶} murmura-t-elle.
\end{quote}

Elle prit une pause et alla √† la cuisine pour prendre son go√ªter et son regard fut captur√© par l'assiette compartiment√©e qui contenait des condiments : il y avait de la mayonnaise, du ketchup, de la moutarde et du houmous. \\
En la regardant, St√©fy se demanda √† quoi ressemblerait sa for√™t imaginaire si elle √©tait divis√©e comme cette assiette, avec les saisons √† la place des condiments. \\

Elle s'assied sur l'une des chaises de la cuisine et se replongea dans son monde.\\
Si elle pouvait voir la for√™t de haut, elle aurait pu remarquer que celle-ci avait des bordures distinctes cette fois : on pouvait clairement voir o√π une partie se termine pour laisser place √† une autre. \\
Elle commen√ßa √† explorer cet endroit et ne tarda pas √† constater qu'elle √©tait dans la partie o√π le printemps dominait. Il y avait plein de couleurs, l'air √©tait frais et les sons des animaux animaient l'endroit. \\
Elle vit un √©cureuil courir d'un arbre √† un autre et le suivit. \\

Lorsqu'elle le vit grimper, son attention fut d√©tourn√©e vers les pommes suspendues sur une branche et elle sentit un changement subtil dans la temp√©rature de l'air. \\
\begin{quote}
\textit{-Ah, je vois, c'est l'√©t√© ici‚Ä¶} dit-elle avant de continuer en avant.
\end{quote}

Elle leva le bras pour se prot√©ger les yeux des rayons de soleil qui transper√ßaient les feuilles des arbres, dessinant des motifs myst√©rieux avec des ombres et des lumi√®res sur le sol. Un vent soudain la fit marcher plus rapidement et elle baissa son bras lorsqu'elle entendit le son des feuilles mortes sur lesquelles elle marchait. \\
Les arbres √©taient √† pr√©sent v√™tus de feuilles jaunes, oranges, rouges et marrons, et elle sentit une odeur agr√©able de terre humide et de champignons. \\
Elle se pencha au bord d'une rivi√®re et retira sa main aussit√¥t qu'elle l'√©tendit pour toucher l'eau. Elle regarda l'autre c√¥t√© de la rivi√®re et vit que les arbres √©taient d√©v√™tus de leurs feuillages et recouverts d'une √©paisse couche de neige. \\

Lorsqu'elle ouvrit les yeux, elle sourit et prit une brioche au chocolat avant de retourner dans sa chambre pour transformer ses pens√©es en mots. \\

Le lendemain, lorsqu'elle lut son expression √©crite, toute la classe, y compris son enseignant, l'applaudit chaleureusement, et tout le monde exprima son envie de visiter sa for√™t quatre-saisons.

Give me a reading comprehension exercise for a student learning French. It should have a subsection for answers.,"Eleanor tapota ses doigts sur son bureau en observant la progression de ses t√©l√©chargements sur l'√©cran de son ordinateur. \\
Elle avait trouv√© de tr√®s bons jeux en ligne et elle pensait qu'elle allait pouvoir s'amuser en y jouant et passer le temps durant ses vacances d'√©t√© quand il ferait trop chaud pour sortir jouer dehors. \\
Cependant, apr√®s avoir vu les descriptions des jeux, elle devint surexcit√©e et voulut les essayer imm√©diatement. \\
Le seul probl√®me √©tait qu'ils prenaient trop de temps pour se t√©l√©charger et elle commen√ßa √† perdre patience. \\

\textit{-Arrghhh !} elle cria avec frustration. \textit{Allez ! Plus rapidement, je vous en supplie !} \\

Sa grande s≈ìur qui passait devant sa chambre √† ce moment-l√† devint curieuse et frappa sur la porte ouverte de sa chambre. \\
\textit{-Est-ce que je peux entrer ?} demanda-t-elle. \\
\textit{-Bien s√ªr...} r√©pondit Eleanor avec distraction. \\

\textit{-Qu'est-ce qui se passe, Elle ?} sa s≈ìur demanda en s'asseyant sur le bord de son lit. \\
\textit{-C'est juste cette stupide connexion internet qui est trop lente ! J'attends le t√©l√©chargement de ces fichiers depuis des lustres !} La fillette r√©pondit avec rage. \\

\textit{-Tu es en train de t√©l√©charger des fichiers ? Est-ce qu'ils proviennent d'une source s√©curis√©e ?} sa s≈ìur demanda en mettant une m√®che de ses cheveux derri√®re son oreille et en se penchant en avant pour regarder l'√©cran de l'ordinateur. \\

Eleanor haussa ses √©paules et dit qu'elle n'avait pas v√©rifi√© la source en r√©alit√©. \\
\textit{-Je ne connais m√™me pas la diff√©rence entre une source qui est s√©curis√©e et une autre qui ne l'est pas.} \\

\textit{-Eh bien, laisse-moi te montrer.} Sa s≈ìur se leva et se mit derri√®re sa chaise avant de se pencher en avant et de prendre la souris. \\
Elle alla sur un site et utilisa le curseur de la souris pour montrer la partie sup√©rieure du navigateur o√π le lien du site √©tait √©crit. \\

\textit{-Tu vois ce cadenas ? √áa veut dire que le site sur lequel tu es est s√ªr et v√©rifi√©. Tout ce que tu t√©l√©charges depuis ce site ne va pas faire de mal √† ton ordinateur,} elle l'informa avant de lui demander d'aller sur le site depuis lequel elle avait t√©l√©charg√© ses jeux. \\

\textit{-Regarde ! Il y a un cadenas vert !} La fillette dit en montrant du doigt l'ic√¥ne en question. \\

Sa s≈ìur hocha la t√™te avant de fermer l'onglet. \\
\textit{-Oui, ce site est aussi s√©curis√©. Donc, tes jeux ne sont pas dangereux.} \\

Eleanor hocha la t√™te, ayant compris. \\
\textit{-Qu'est-ce qui se passerait si je t√©l√©charge des trucs √† partir de sites non v√©rifi√©s ?} \\

\textit{-Eh bien, √ßa d√©pend. Parfois, rien de grave. Si tu as de la chance, rien de mauvais ne se passe, mais parfois tu peux avoir des virus sur ton syst√®me.} \\

Eleanor pencha la t√™te curieusement sur le c√¥t√© et demanda √† sa s≈ìur ce qu'√©tait un virus et comment cela fonctionnait. \\
\textit{-J'entends toujours les gens en parler, mais je n'ai jamais compris ce qu'est vraiment un virus d'ordinateur.} \\

\textit{-Bon alors, un virus d'ordinateur est un type de logiciel malveillant.} \\
\textit{Comme d'autres logiciels de ce genre, les virus sont des programmes qui s'ex√©cutent avec d'autres programmes.} \\

\textit{Dans notre cas, un virus pourrait s'ex√©cuter avec l'un des jeux que tu es en train de t√©l√©charger et se copier sur ton syst√®me.} \\
\textit{Il peut ex√©cuter des instructions dangereuses qui peuvent endommager tes fichiers et ralentir ton ordinateur.} \\

\textit{-Oh ! C'est ce qui se passe quand on attrape froid, n'est-ce pas ? √áa rentre dans nos corps et nous rend malade et alit√©s,} la petite fille remarqua. \\

\textit{-Oui ! En fait, c'est la raison pour laquelle ce type de logiciel malveillant est nomm√© un virus.} \\
\textit{Car √ßa marche de la m√™me mani√®re qu'un virus de rhume ou de grippe,} sa s≈ìur lui dit. \\

\textit{-Tu continues √† r√©p√©ter les mots ‚Äúce type de logiciel malveillant‚Äù, quels sont les autres types ?} Eleanor demanda en se penchant en avant dans sa chaise. \\

\textit{-Eh bien, il y a plusieurs autres types. L'un d'eux est un type qu'on appelle un cheval de Troie.} \\
\textit{Connais-tu l'histoire du cheval de Troie dans l'histoire ?} \\

Eleanor secoua la t√™te, indiquant que non. \\
\textit{-Bon, dans la mythologie grecque, on dit que la femme du roi de Sparte, H√©l√®ne, avait √©t√© kidnapp√©e et emmen√©e √† Troie.} \\
\textit{Ceci poussa le roi √† demander de l'aide aupr√®s des Grecs qui accept√®rent d'aller au secours d'H√©l√®ne.} \\

\textit{Mais, la cit√© de Troie √©tait prot√©g√©e par de grands murs et on ne pouvait pas y acc√©der facilement et donc le g√©n√©ral Grec Ulysse pensa √† jouer un tour pour s'y introduire et sauver H√©l√®ne avec ses guerriers.} \\

\textit{Et donc, les Grecs b√¢tirent un immense cheval en bois et le laiss√®rent hors du portail de Troie en guise d'offrande et l'arm√©e fit semblant de battre en retraite.} \\

\textit{Les gens de Troie, contents de leur victoire, tir√®rent le cheval √† l'int√©rieur de la cit√© et le mirent au centre pour que tout le monde puisse l'admirer.} \\

\textit{La nuit, quand tout le monde dormait, quelques guerriers qui √©taient cach√©s √† l'int√©rieur du cheval en sortirent et ouvrirent les portails de Troie pour le reste de l'arm√©e et √† partir de l√†, tu peux facilement deviner qui avait gagn√© cette guerre.} \\

Eleanor √©couta l'histoire avec fascination avant de demander quel lien √ßa avait avec le logiciel malveillant. \\
\textit{-Le cheval de Troie marche d'une fa√ßon semblable.} \\
\textit{Il se fait passer pour un logiciel inoffensif pour te pousser √† le t√©l√©charger et l'installer et une fois sur ton syst√®me, il peut donner acc√®s aux attaquants √† tes fichiers et ils pourront t'espionner, voler tes fichiers et m√™me t√©l√©charger plus de logiciels malveillants sur ton ordinateur.} \\

\textit{-Oh... C'est horrible !} Eleanor dit en regardant l'√©cran de son ordinateur. \\

Ses t√©l√©chargements √©taient toujours en cours et elle retourna son attention sur sa s≈ìur. \\
\textit{Comment pourrais-je prot√©ger mon ordinateur des logiciels malveillants ?} \\

\textit{-Tu peux utiliser un logiciel antivirus.} \\
\textit{Ils te pr√©viennent en g√©n√©ral quand tu es sur le point de t√©l√©charger quelque chose de suspect et tu peux m√™me les utiliser pour nettoyer ton ordinateur et te d√©barrasser des logiciels malveillants qui y sont d√©j√†.} \\

\textit{Comme je l'ai d√©j√† dit, √©vite d'aller sur des sites qui ne sont pas v√©rifi√©s et s√©curis√©s et ne t√©l√©charge rien √† partir d'une source inconnue.} \\

\textit{Et pour √™tre s√ªr, s'il y a des fichiers importants sur ton ordinateur, fais-en une copie de secours et charge-la sur un drive en ligne ou sur une cl√© USB juste pour ne pas perdre tes donn√©es au cas o√π quelque chose arrive √† ton syst√®me.} \\

Eleanor hocha la t√™te avec enthousiasme et remercia sa s≈ìur pour ses explications. \\
\textit{-Tout est plus clair maintenant.} \\

Elle se tourna vers son ordinateur et vit que les t√©l√©chargements de ses jeux √©taient termin√©s et elle lan√ßa leurs installations avec excitation. \\
Maintenant qu'elle √©tait s√ªre qu'ils n'√©taient pas dangereux pour son ordinateur, elle allait s'amuser en y jouant encore plus.

Give me a reading comprehension exercise for a student learning French. It should have a subsection for answers.,"Jennie, Marshall et Ophelia se rassembl√®rent au centre de la maison. Chaque fin de semaine, ils incitaient leur m√®re √† sortir avec ses amies et √† se d√©tendre pendant qu'ils nettoyaient la maison avec l'aide de leur p√®re et sous sa surveillance.

\textit{-Alors voil√†, puisqu'on est √† court de certaines choses, Papa est sorti acheter ce dont on a besoin mais on peut quand m√™me diviser les t√¢ches maintenant.} Ophelia, l'a√Æn√©e, dit sur un ton enfantin mais ferme. Son fr√®re et sa s≈ìur hoch√®rent la t√™te en accord et attendirent qu'elle d√©l√©gua leurs t√¢ches.

\textit{-Comme d'habitude, Papa va s'occuper des cuvettes, fen√™tres et miroirs.} Elle commen√ßa. \textit{Jennie, tu as fait la vaisselle la semaine pass√©e, donc Marshall va faire cela cette semaine.} Dit-elle √† sa s≈ìur. \textit{Tu vas passer l'aspirateur au salon et au couloir tandis que je m'occupe du linge et je vais aussi faire le parterre de la cuisine. Est-ce que tout le monde a compris?} Encore une fois, les enfants les plus jeunes hoch√®rent leurs t√™tes.

√Ä peine un moment plus tard, leur p√®re ouvrit la porte et ils se dirig√®rent tous vers la cuisine pour leurs nouveaux produits de nettoyage. Marshall prit une paire de gants et une bouteille de savon √† vaisselle.

\textit{-Est-ce que je peux aussi remplacer la vieille √©ponge? Elle est devenue d√©gueulasse.} Il demanda √† son p√®re qui hocha la t√™te.

\textit{-Je vais aussi changer la brosse des toilettes. Il est bien de changer les outils fr√©quemment, plus ils deviennent us√©s plus ils contiennent de bact√©ries.} Son p√®re dit en prenant deux flacons vaporisateurs, une brosse, une paire de gants et un masque qui le prot√©gerait des produits chimiques qui √©taient dans les produits de nettoyage. Jennie, qui √©tait charg√©e de passer l'aspirateur, prit √©galement un des masques pour se prot√©ger de la poussi√®re.

Et quand tout le monde avait ce dont ils avaient besoin, ils se tap√®rent les mains et se mirent au travail.

\textit{-Allez, les enfants. Montrons √† Maman comment le nettoyage professionnel se fait!} Leur p√®re dit. Le seul qui resta dans la cuisine √©tait Marshall vu qu'il √©tait celui qui allait faire la vaisselle. La premi√®re chose qu'il fit √©tait de porter le tablier √† froufrous de sa m√®re vu que celui de son p√®re √©tait trop grand pour lui. Il tourna et rigola en voyant le tablier se bouffer autour de lui. Puis, il glissa ses mains dans les gants en caoutchouc et remplit la cuvette d'eau avant d'ajouter le savon √† vaisselle.

Il agita ses mains dans l'eau jusqu'√† ce qu'elle devienne mousseuse et pleine de bulles et il s'amusa √† faire de petites formes avec la mousse et √† souffler sur les bulles. Il commen√ßa √† chantonner le g√©n√©rique de son dessin anim√© pr√©f√©r√© et se mit √† frotter les plats sales, s'assurant que chaque t√¢che √©tait partie. Ce serait dommage si sa m√®re devait les laver une deuxi√®me fois s'il ne faisait pas son travail proprement.

De l'autre c√¥t√© du mur qui s√©parait la cuisine du salon, Jennie avait commenc√© par faire un peu d'ordre. Elle aimait pr√©tendre qu'elle √©tait en mission urgente et donc, elle r√©gla un minuteur sur le t√©l√©phone de son p√®re et hocha sa t√™te avant de commencer. Elle ramassa les objets qui √©taient sur son chemin, comme la couverture qui √©tait sur le fauteuil et la bouteille d'eau qui √©tait sur la table basse, et les mit √† part avant d'essuyer la poussi√®re qui √©tait sur les meubles.

\textit{-La voie est libre!} Annon√ßa-t-elle au salon vide. \textit{Initialisation de la partie deux de la mission.} Dit-elle apr√®s avoir d√©termin√© que rien ne serait sur son chemin. Puis, elle mit l'aspirateur en marche et commen√ßa par le tapis. √Ä chaque fois qu'elle finissait de nettoyer une partie du salon, elle disait: \textit{La voie est s√ªre!}

Dans la salle de bain, Ophelia tria le linge sale et s√©para les v√™tements color√©s des blancs. Elle aimait empiler les v√™tements color√©s dans l'ordre de leur apparition dans l'arc-en-ciel et elle empila les v√™tements blancs en commen√ßant par ceux les moins purs √† ceux qui √©taient aussi blancs que de la neige.

Elle remplit le bouchon de d√©tergent et le mit dans le compartiment correspondant de la machine √† laver apr√®s s'√™tre assur√©e qu'elle avait bien mesur√©. Cela lui donna l'impression d'√™tre une chimiste, et elle commen√ßa √† mettre les v√™tements dans la machine. Elle appuya sur quelques boutons et le cycle de lavage se lan√ßa.

Le p√®re de famille allait de chambre en chambre, nettoyant les fen√™tres et les miroirs. La chambre de Marshall n'avait que le miroir qui √©tait mont√© sur son armoire et une seule fen√™tre, et donc il commen√ßa par elle, vu qu'elle √©tait la plus facile √† nettoyer. Et si quelqu'un lui avait demand√© quelle pi√®ce √©tait la plus difficile, il aurait dit que c'√©tait le salon avec ses fen√™tres qui allaient du sol au plafond.

Il √©tait impatient de voir ses enfants grandir pour qu'ils puissent l'aider √† les nettoyer. Pour l'instant, c'√©tait lui et sa femme qui s'en occupaient, vu que c'√©tait trop dangereux pour les enfants de monter sur des chaises pour arriver aux parties les plus hautes et il se pourrait que l'un d'eux perde son √©quilibre et tombe.

Quand les v√™tements avaient fini leur cycle de lavage et firent un tour dans le s√®che-linge, Marshall avait fini de faire la vaisselle et les membres de la famille firent une rotation dans les chambres. Papa alla √† la salle de bain pour nettoyer les cuvettes, Ophelia alla √† la cuisine pour faire le parterre et Marshall alla dans sa chambre pour organiser son bureau et ranger ses jouets.

Jennie, d'autre part, √©tait en train de passer l'aspirateur dans la chambre de ses parents. Tous les enfants avaient trouv√© un moyen de s'amuser en faisant leurs t√¢ches et l'id√©e de rendre leur m√®re fi√®re et heureuse les poussa √† travailler dur.

Quand tout le monde avait fini ses corv√©es, leur p√®re les emmena d√©jeuner dehors. \textit{-C'est plus juste ainsi. Nous aussi on a le droit de manger dans un restaurant √©l√©gant, n'est-ce pas?} Il leur dit en rigolant. Ils savour√®rent tous leurs plats et retourn√®rent chez eux. Comme chaque week-end, leur m√®re exprima sa joie et son appr√©ciation de leur travail et leur consid√©ration avant de leur donner des cadeaux qu'elle leur avait ramen√©s de sa sortie. Certains √©taient des p√¢tisseries, d'autres √©taient des breloques mais tout le monde √©tait d'accord que le meilleur cadeau √©tait l'expression de fiert√© dans les yeux de leur m√®re quand elle vit la maison briller de propret√©.

Die H√§nde des alten Mannes zitterten, seine Sicht war schwach und seine Beine dienten ihm nicht sehr gut.\\ 
\textit{A sluggish old man lived with his son, daughter in law, and four-year-old grandson. The old man's hands shivered, his vision was weak, and his legs did not serve him very well.}\\ 

Wenn die Familie sich zum Essen an den Tisch setzte, w√ºrden die zitternden H√§nde des Gro√üvaters und die geringe Sehkraft das Essen sehr schwierig und unangenehm machen. \\
\textit{When the family would sit down at the table to eat, the grandfather‚Äôs shaking hands and low vision would make the meal very difficult and unpleasant.} \\

Das Essen w√ºrde vom L√∂ffel auf den Boden fallen. \\
\textit{The food would fall from the spoon to the floor. }\\

Wenn er das Glas heben wollte, w√ºrde die Milch auf den Tisch fallen. \\
\textit{If he wanted to get a glass, the milk would go down on the table.} \\

Ich habe genug von der versch√ºtteten Milch, lautem Essen und Essen auf dem Boden. \\

Der Sohn und die Schwiegertochter stellten einen kleinen Tisch in die Ecke des Zimmers auf. \\

Der Gro√üvater a√ü dort, w√§hrend der Rest der Familie das Essen genoss. \\

Als der Gro√üvater ein paar Schalen zerbrach, wurde sein Essen in einer Holzschale serviert. \\
\textit{After the grandfather had broken a few bowls, his food was served in a wooden bowl. }\\

Wenn die Familie manchmal den Gro√üvater ansah, sahen sie manchmal die Tr√§nen in seinen Augen, wenn er allein da sa√ü. \\
\textit{When the family looked at the grandfather, they would sometimes see the tears in his eyes as he sat there alone.} \\

Dennoch, die einzigen Worte, die das junge Paar f√ºr ihn hatte, waren Worte der Wut, wenn etwas auf den Boden fiel. \\
\textit{Nevertheless, the only words the young couple had for him were words of anger if something fell to the floor.} \\

Es war der erste gro√üe Streit seit vierzig Jahren, seit sie Seite an Seite lebten, Werkzeuge teilten und sich gegenseitig halfen. \\

Du siehst diesen Stamm neben der Scheune? \\

Ich will, dass du einen zwei Meter langen Zaun baust, damit ich ihn und sein Haus nicht mehr sehen kann.‚Äù \\
\textit{I want you to make me a two-meter-long fence so I cannot even see him or his house anymore.‚Äù }\\

Give me a reading comprehension exercise for a student learning French. It should have a subsection for answers.,"Marianne, assise sur la chaise de bureau de son grand fr√®re, lui racontait avec enthousiasme qu'elle √©tait √©lue par sa classe pour √©crire un po√®me pour la comp√©tition de son √©cole. \\
Elle lui dit qu'elle voulait √©crire quelque chose sur la nature et qu'elle voulait commencer imm√©diatement. \\
\textit{-Et bien, vas-y !} dit-il apr√®s avoir exprim√© sa fiert√© d'elle. \textit{Je vais te pr√™ter mon dictionnaire si tu veux !} Il l'encouragea. \\
Marianne rit avec amusement et lui dit qu'elle n'avait pas besoin d'un dictionnaire. \\
\textit{-Je n'ai pas √©t√© √©lue pour rien, voyons !} lui dit-elle. \textit{Je connais tous les mots, j'ai m√™me gagn√© la comp√©tition d'orthographe de mon √©cole !} \\
Grand fr√®re sourit et souleva un sourcil avec √©tonnement. \\
\textit{-Personne ne conna√Æt tous les mots, Anne. M√™me les grands professeurs de litt√©rature.} \\
\textit{-Et bien, tant pis pour eux ! Moi je sais que je les connais tous. Je comprends tous les mots dans mon livre de lecture et je n'ai jamais eu besoin d'un dictionnaire !} r√©pondit la petite fille. \\
\textit{-Il est vrai que pour ton √¢ge, tu as plus de connaissances que les autres en litt√©rature, mais il y a s√ªrement quelques mots que tu ignores.} \\
\textit{-Non, aucun !} Grand fr√®re adorait Marianne et ne voulait pas lui faire de peine, mais il ne voulait pas non plus qu'elle continue √† penser qu'elle √©tait arriv√©e au bout du chemin concernant son √©ducation. \\
Il √©tait fier du fait qu'elle avait de la confiance en soi, mais il savait que √ßa pouvait tr√®s vite se transformer en arrogance et cela l'emp√™cherait d'apprendre davantage de choses √† l'avenir. \\
Il √©tait s√ªr qu'elle avait encore beaucoup √† apprendre et il voulait l'aider. \\

Il passa quelques minutes √† penser √† une bonne m√©thode pour la corriger sans la vexer et finit par lui sugg√©rer de lui apprendre des choses √† lui. \\
\textit{-Contrairement √† toi, je ne connais malheureusement pas tous les mots‚Ä¶} argumenta-t-il avec tristesse. \\
Marianne, qui aimait son grand fr√®re et d√©testait le voir m√©content, accepta imm√©diatement de lui apprendre les mots qu'il ne connaissait pas. \\
\textit{-Peut-√™tre que tu peux me donner des descriptions des choses dont tu ne connais pas le nom et je te dirai comment elles s'appellent.} \\
\textit{-C'est une tr√®s bonne id√©e !} dit-il avec joie. \textit{Tu sais quoi, il fait beau aujourd'hui. On devrait sortir dans le jardin, comme √ßa tu vas aussi √™tre inspir√©e pour ton po√®me.} \\
Marianne accepta d'aller dehors et prit avec elle un petit carnet et un stylo, quant √† son grand fr√®re, il n'emporta que son t√©l√©phone portable avec lui. \\

Les deux s'install√®rent sur le gazon et Marianne lui dit de commencer. \\
Grand fr√®re, ne voulant pas la d√©courager, commen√ßa par quelque chose de plut√¥t facile. \\
\textit{-Tu sais ce qu'on appelle √ßa ?} dit-il en lui montrant les petites boules de tissu qui s'√©taient form√©es sur son pull. \\
\textit{-Oh, √ßa, c'est de la bouloche !} r√©pondit Marianne imm√©diatement. \\
\textit{-Je vois ! Et ces herbes que Maman utilise dans la cuisine ?} dit-il en pointant le doigt vers le petit jardin potager. \\
\textit{-Ce sont des aromates !} \\
\textit{-Tu peux me dire ce qu'on appelle une personne qui fait des acrobaties devant les gens dans la rue ?} \\
\textit{-Euh, un clown ? Un acrobate ?} \\
\textit{-Non, non, je crois qu'ils ont une autre appellation.} \\
\textit{-Je n'en connais pas d'autres,} r√©pondit Marianne avec embarras. \\
\textit{-Ne t'inqui√®te pas, on va chercher sur internet.} Grand fr√®re √©crit quelques mots sur le clavier de son t√©l√©phone puis montra √† Marianne le contenu de son √©cran. \\
\textit{-Ah, regarde l√† ! √áa s'appelle un saltimbanque.} \\
\textit{-Oh ! Bon, d'accord alors. Je ne connais pas un mot, ce n'est pas grave ! Vas-y ! D√©cris-moi autre chose !} dit-elle. \\
\textit{-Comment s'appelle le plat que Maman fait avec des haricots blancs et des saucissons ?} \\
\textit{-Le cassoulet !} \\
\textit{-Oh ! Et celui avec les choux ferment√©s ?} \\
\textit{-La choucroute !} Grand fr√®re l'applaudit avec admiration. \\
\textit{-Tu peux me dire ce qu'on appelle l'√©levage de lapins domestiques ?} \\
Marianne pensa un moment avant de dire qu'elle ne croyait pas qu'il y avait un mot pour √ßa, mais grand fr√®re lui dit qu'il valait mieux v√©rifier quand m√™me. \\
\textit{-Ah ! L√† ! Cuniculture !} \\
\textit{-C'est mignon comme mot,} dit Marianne en rigolant. \\
\textit{-Bon, continuons,} dit grand fr√®re. \textit{Comment s'appellent ces fleurs ?} dit-il en montrant de belles fleurs aux p√©tales roses. \\
\textit{-Des‚Ä¶ euh, je ne sais pas,} r√©pondit Marianne. \\

Il en prit une photo et lan√ßa une recherche bas√©e sur images. \\
\textit{-Regarde, on dit ici que √ßa s'appelle des rhododendrons.} \\
\textit{-C'est un peu difficile √† prononcer, hein ?} lui demanda-t-elle. \\
\textit{-Tout √† fait. Reprenant, tu veux bien ?} \\
\textit{-Non‚Ä¶ Tu sais‚Ä¶ je ne suis plus aussi s√ªre que je connais tous les mots, apr√®s tout. J'en connais beaucoup, mais il y en a pas mal que je ne connais pas.} \\
\textit{-Ce n'est pas grave,} dit Grand Fr√®re. \textit{Tu peux toujours les apprendre, tu es encore jeune. Peut-√™tre que lorsque tu auras mon √¢ge, tu vas les conna√Ætre tous !} \\
\textit{-Peut-√™tre m√™me avant !} dit Marianne avec enthousiasme. \\
\textit{-Oui ! Pourquoi pas !} \\

Ils gard√®rent le silence pendant un moment puis Marianne leva timidement sa t√™te. \\
\textit{-Tu veux bien m'apprendre comment chercher des mots sur internet comme tu le fais ?} \\
\textit{-Bien s√ªr !} dit Grand Fr√®re. \textit{Et je peux m√™me te montrer comment le faire sur un dictionnaire, tu peux aussi t'en servir pour apprendre plus de mots.} \\
\textit{-D'accord ! Merci.} Grand Fr√®re lui dit qu'ils feraient mieux de rentrer. \\

Give me a reading comprehension exercise for a student learning French. It should have a subsection for answers.,"En un jour chaud et ensoleill√©, tandis que les criquets chantaient et que les fourmis montaient en queue sur un arbre, Jacob √©tait √† quatre pattes dans le petit jardin de sa maison et cherchait sans rel√¢che dans l'herbe en qu√™te du tr√®fle √† quatre feuilles l√©gendaire. \\
Le but principal de sa recherche √©tait de s'attribuer la chance qui venait de l'objet, comme tout le monde. \\
Il ne croyait pas qu'il allait trouver facilement un fer √† cheval dans la ville et il ne voulait certainement pas avoir la patte d'un lapin ! Quel genre de personne sans c≈ìur pourrait faire √ßa √† un pauvre lapin ?! \\
Et donc, sa seule option √©tait un tr√®fle √† quatre feuilles. S'il arrivait √† l'avoir, il aurait de la chance et s'il avait de la chance, tout irait √† merveille dans sa vie. \\

Le seul probl√®me √©tait que, malgr√© sa recherche m√©ticuleuse, il n'arrivait pas √† trouver l'objet en question. \\
Il commen√ßait √† se sentir frustr√© apr√®s une demi-heure de recherche et il consid√©rait s√©rieusement d'abandonner sa t√¢che. \\
\textit{-Je commence √† croire qu'ils n'ont jamais exist√©...} murmura-t-il de mani√®re grincheuse en se tapotant les mains pour se d√©barrasser de la terre avec un souffle. \\

\textit{-Qu'est-ce qui te fait marmonner comme √ßa, petit ?} La voix de sa grande s≈ìur survint de derri√®re lui, le faisant sursauter. \\
\textit{-Leah ! Ne viens pas derri√®re les gens ainsi !} la gronda-t-il en fron√ßant les sourcils. \\
\textit{-Pardon,} dit-elle en rigolant avant de s'asseoir sur l'herbe √† c√¥t√© de lui. \\
\textit{-Alors, pourquoi es-tu si contrari√© ?} demanda-t-elle en lui pin√ßant la joue avant qu'il ne tape sa main. \\

Il laissa √©chapper un souffle avec un regard mis√©rable et se massa la tempe pour se calmer. \\
\textit{-J'ai cherch√© partout √† travers le jardin pour trouver un tr√®fle √† quatre feuilles mais apparemment, tous les tr√®fles ici n'ont que trois feuilles.} \\

\textit{-Je vois,} Leah dit en mettant un bras sur ses genoux avant de mettre son menton dessus. \\
\textit{-Et pourquoi as-tu besoin d'en trouver un √† quatre feuilles ?} \\

\textit{-Pour avoir de la chance, bien s√ªr. Pourquoi d'autre ?} dit-il en froissant son front. \\
\textit{-Et bien, pourquoi as-tu besoin d'avoir de la chance ?} \\
Est-ce qu'elle jouait l'idiote expr√®s ? Il savait √† quel point elle √©tait intelligente, alors elle √©tait s√ªrement en train de le taquiner. \\
Jacob n'√©tait pas d'humeur √† se faire taquiner ! \\

\textit{-Et bien pour tout ! La chance nous aide avec tout, n'est-ce pas ? √áa rend tout plus facile et meilleur ! Je serai meilleur en football et j'aurai de meilleures notes et je gagnerai chaque partie de jeux vid√©o que je jouerai !} expliqua-t-il en agitant ses mains un peu partout. \\

Sa grande s≈ìur rigola et lui √©bouriffa les cheveux. \\
\textit{-Calme-toi, mon grand. Je comprends.} \\
\textit{-Alors tu vois pourquoi j'ai besoin de le trouver.} \\

\textit{-Je ne crois pas que la chance marche autant que tu le penses, tu sais ?} Leah dit. \\
Jacob souffla et roula des yeux. \\
\textit{-Ouais, c'est √ßa. Elle ne savait rien... Les adultes ne savaient rien sur ses probl√®mes.} \\

\textit{-Non, je suis s√©rieuse. Est-ce que tu connais quelqu'un qui a r√©ussi dans sa vie en comptant sur la chance ?} lui demanda-t-elle en arquant ses sourcils. \\
\textit{-Et bien... non, mais...} Il prit un moment pour penser √† un argument mais ne pouvait pas en avoir un. \\

\textit{-Tu vois ? La majorit√© des gens qui ont accompli leurs buts comptent sur autre chose. Peux-tu deviner ce que c'est ?} demanda-t-elle avec un sourire taquin. \\
\textit{-Les miracles ?} Jacob r√©pondit avec sarcasme, la faisant rire. \\
\textit{-Non, petit malin ! Le travail. Les gens travaillent dur pour r√©aliser leurs r√™ves. Ils s'am√©liorent dans leur m√©tier en travaillant dur et en s'appliquant et ils amassent de l'exp√©rience et du savoir qui les aideraient par la suite √† travailler plus rapidement et de fa√ßon meilleure,} expliqua-t-elle. \\

\textit{-Ah, bon ? Donne-moi un exemple.} Le petit gar√ßon la d√©fia en croisant les bras. \\
\textit{-Toi ! Tu te rappelles √† quel point tu √©tais faible en Histoire ?} Jacob fit une grimace en pensant √† ses vieilles notes en Histoire. \\
Il d√©testait la mati√®re et avait refus√© de la r√©viser. \\

Mais, il √©tait arriv√© √† s'y am√©liorer et il avait trouv√© une mani√®re de m√©moriser ses le√ßons de mani√®re efficace quand il s'√©tait d√©cid√© √† le faire et avec l'aide de Leah. \\
Maintenant, l'Histoire √©tait devenue l'une de ses mati√®res pr√©f√©r√©es et il n'avait que de bonnes notes. \\

\textit{-D'accord. Quoi d'autre ?} demanda-t-il, pas tr√®s convaincu. \\
Leah se tourna pour regarder la maison puis autour d'elle pour s'assurer que personne d'autre que Jacob ne pouvait l'entendre. \\
\textit{-Tu te souviens √† quel point Maman √©tait mauvaise en jardinage ?} \\

Jacob rigola en pensant √† toutes les pauvres plantes que sa m√®re avait noy√©es en les arrosant plus qu'il ne fallait. \\
\textit{-Elle a fait beaucoup de progr√®s...} dit-il en regardant les rosiers qui √©taient en pleine floraison gr√¢ce aux soins de sa m√®re. \\

\textit{-Et tout le monde sait que j'√©tais tr√®s mauvaise en basketball quand je venais tout juste de commencer. Maintenant, regarde-moi ! Apr√®s des mois et des mois de travail dur, je suis devenue capitaine de mon √©quipe √† l'√©cole !} Leah dit avec un sourire fier. \\

\textit{-C'est vrai. Papa n'arr√™te pas de parler de tes exploits,} Jacob dit avec un sourire taquin. \\
\textit{-Tu vois ? En r√©alit√©, tout le monde peut devenir excellent dans n'importe quel domaine. Tu es devenu meilleur en Histoire apr√®s avoir fait des efforts. Maman est devenue meilleure en jardinage parce qu'elle a refus√© d'abandonner malgr√© toutes les plantes qu'elle avait tu√©es et moi, je suis devenue meilleure en basketball apr√®s des heures et des heures d'entra√Ænement.} \\

\textit{Toute personne qui est bonne dans un domaine √©tait mauvaise au d√©but et s'est seulement am√©lior√©e apr√®s s'√™tre exerc√©e et avoir travaill√© dur. La chance est une jolie chose mais si tout le monde comptait sur elle, on n'aurait pas de progr√®s dans tous les domaines.} \\

Jacob hocha la t√™te et sourit. \\
\textit{-Je comprends. Et puis qui a besoin de chance ? Je peux tout faire tout seul.} \\

\textit{-Et si tu as des soucis, tu peux toujours demander de l'aide,} Leah lui rappela avec un sourire. \\
Jacob sourit et la regarda d'un air penaud. \\
\textit{-Alors... tu veux bien m'aider pour trouver le tr√®fle √† quatre feuilles...? Pas pour avoir de la chance ! Juste parce que je pense que ce serait cool d'en trouver un !} \\

Leah roula les yeux au ciel avec une expression affectueuse et lui sourit avant que les deux ne recommencent √† chercher le fameux objet porteur de chance.

Give me a reading comprehension exercise for a student learning French. It should have a subsection for answers.,"Le soleil baignait le monde dans sa chaleur et sa lumi√®re √©claircissait les fleurs en √©closion. \\
Ce beau matin, une petite fille regardait le joli jardin de sa grand-m√®re depuis le bord de la fen√™tre de sa chambre, en tenant un verre de limonade dans sa main. \\
Elle soupira joyeusement apr√®s avoir pris une bonne bouff√©e d'air frais qui portait les douces odeurs des plantes puis, pencha sa t√™te sur la fen√™tre, ayant la paisible sensation d'√™tre chez elle. \\

Soudain, un petit mouvement irr√©gulier saisit son attention et elle concentra son regard sur la source de ce mouvement qui √©tait une toute petite araign√©e suspendue au bout d'un fil qui √©tait emport√© par la brise. \\
Felicity rigola sur la sc√®ne bizarre qui lui rappela, en fait, un film qu'elle avait regard√© il n'y avait pas tr√®s longtemps avec ses grands-parents. \\

\textit{-Cette araign√©e para√Æt exactement comme les cambrioleurs qui √©taient descendus du plafond pour voler le joyau du mus√©e royal,} pensa-t-elle en regardant le petit insecte s'√©loigner d'elle, flottant vers l'inconnu. \\

Elle tourna son regard vers la plante empot√©e qui √©tait juste sous la fen√™tre et regarda une abeille qui avait la t√™te dans une fleur et elle laissa √©chapper un rire. \\
\textit{-Quelle petite cr√©ature loufoque !} dit-elle en regardant le petit insecte volant se tortiller pour aller plus profond√©ment dans la fleur. \\

Les abeilles travaillaient tellement dur ! La petite fille soupira et pensa que la vie devait √™tre tr√®s int√©ressante pour les insectes. \\
Elle se demanda ce que √ßa ferait de voir les choses de leur perspective. \\

Tout devait para√Ætre gigantesque et les petits brins d'herbe qu'elle voyait devaient √™tre une jungle pour les minuscules insectes qui r√©sidaient dans le jardin de sa grand-m√®re. \\

\textit{-Si seulement je pouvais r√©tr√©cir pour un jour...} pensa-t-elle en baillant avec paresse juste avant de s'endormir contre la fen√™tre. \\

Quand elle se leva, elle √©tait toujours sur le bord de la fen√™tre dans la maison de sa grand-m√®re mais elle √©tait devenue beaucoup plus petite. \\

\textit{-Fais attention √† ce que tu souhaites, hein...?} elle murmura √† elle-m√™me en regardant autour d'elle avec fascination. \\
Elle ne sentit aucun regret, par contre. Elle √©tait excit√©e de vivre ce nouveau changement et √©tait impatiente de voir comment sa journ√©e allait se d√©rouler. \\

Elle passa un peu de temps √† observer son entourage. \\
Tout paraissait diff√©rent. Le verre de limonade - qui √©tait √† pr√©sent ti√®de - dont elle buvait auparavant lui sembla √™tre aussi haut qu'une tour et le bord de la fen√™tre paraissait aussi vaste qu'une autoroute. \\

Les rayons de soleil qui per√ßaient la vitre √©taient √©blouissants et d√©gageaient de la chaleur et elle fit en sorte de se mettre dans les endroits les moins intenses. \\
Ce qu'elle crut √™tre une l√©g√®re brise avant se transforma en un vent soufflant qui lui √©bouriffa les cheveux. \\

Quand elle se tourna pour regarder sa chambre, elle ne put pas voir grand-chose au-del√† de son vaste lit. \\
L'ours en peluche qui y √©tait se tenait comme une statue immense et elle abandonna l'id√©e d'explorer la chambre le moment o√π elle l'eut en t√™te. \\

Elle voulait voir √† quoi le monde ext√©rieur ressemblait et elle n'√©tait pas s√ªre qu'elle allait pouvoir regrimper sur le bord de la fen√™tre plus tard si elle en descendait maintenant. \\
Et donc, en se tournant vers la fen√™tre, elle la regarda pour voir si elle pourrait trouver le chemin le plus facile pour descendre au jardin et sa recherche fut fructueuse en peu de temps. \\

Elle marcha vers l'extr√©mit√© gauche de la fen√™tre et testa les petites branches de la plante qui avaient grimp√© le long des murs de la maison de ses grands-parents et quand elle √©tait s√ªre qu'elles √©taient assez robustes, elle les utilisa pour descendre. \\

L'odeur de l'herbe fra√Æchement tondue la frappa et elle marcha √† travers le gazon en √©cartant les brins d'herbe de son chemin avec ses mains. \\
Elle regarda √† sa droite et vit des fourmis marcher en file √† un rythme rapide. \\
La plupart des fourmis portaient une sorte de graines qui √©taient deux fois plus grandes qu'elles et elle les regarda passer avec admiration. \\

Une fois la parade de fourmis pass√©e, elle reprit son chemin et l'insecte suivant qu'elle vit fut un mille-pattes. \\
Elle laissa √©chapper un souffle effray√© car l'insecte lui parut beaucoup plus intimidant quand elle √©tait aussi petite et elle d√©cida de ne pas bouger et de garder le silence, faisant semblant de ne pas exister jusqu'√† ce que la voie devienne libre. \\

Quand l'insecte ayant plus de pattes qu'elle ne put compter passa, elle reprit son chemin autour du jardin. \\
\textit{-Wow...} murmura-t-elle, impressionn√©e en voyant une libellule juste avant qu'elle ne s'envole. \\
Elle √©tait magnifique et elle se sentit chanceuse d'avoir pu la voir de si pr√®s. \\

En allant plus loin √† travers le jardin, elle rencontra aussi une cr√©ature moins jolie. \\
Elle fit la grimace en d√©go√ªt alors qu'une limace passa devant elle, laissant une tra√Æn√©e de bave qu'elle devait croiser pour continuer en avant. \\

\textit{-Il n'y a rien √† faire...} dit-elle √† elle-m√™me en mettant un pied au-del√† du chemin de bave apr√®s l'autre. \\

Mais, tandis qu'elle √©tait occup√©e √† croiser sans mettre les pieds sur la substance d√©go√ªtante, elle ne vit pas la mante religieuse g√©ante qui la guettait et lorsqu'elle se tourna, elle la vit sauter sur elle. \\

Avant qu'elle n'e√ªt le temps de crier, elle se trouva en l'air et quand elle regarda en haut, elle ne put voir que les grandes ailes color√©es d'un papillon. \\
L'insecte la d√©posa sur le bord de la fen√™tre et inclina la t√™te avant de s'envoler. \\

\textit{-Merci de m'avoir sauv√© !} Felicity cria en agitant la main en l'air. \\
\textit{Je crois que cela me fait assez d'excitation pour aujourd'hui...} se dit-elle en glissant sur le rideau et avant de grimper sur ses draps. \\

Elle se mit sur son lit √† c√¥t√© de l'ours en peluche g√©ant et d√©cida de prendre une sieste apr√®s sa marche fatigante √† travers le jardin g√©ant. \\
Elle ferma les yeux et elle sut que lorsqu'elle les ouvrirait la prochaine fois, elle aurait regagn√© sa taille normale.

Give me a combination of a word problem and a problem-solving exercise for a 5th grade student learning mathematics. It should have a subsection for answers.,"India has a bowl of fruit. \( \frac{1}{4} \) are apples, \( \frac{1}{3} \) are papayas, \( \frac{1}{6} \) are mangos, and the other fruit are bananas. Calculate the possible numbers of each fruit. Your answer should use a common denominator.

\subsection*{Answers}
Let the total number of fruits be \( x \). Then:
\begin{itemize}
\item Number of apples = \( \frac{1}{4}x \)
\item Number of papayas = \( \frac{1}{3}x \)
\item Number of mangos = \( \frac{1}{6}x \)
\item Number of bananas = \( x - \left(\frac{1}{4}x + \frac{1}{3}x + \frac{1}{6}x\right) \)
\end{itemize}

To find a common denominator, we can use 12:
\begin{itemize}
\item Number of apples = \( \frac{3}{12}x \)
\item Number of papayas = \( \frac{4}{12}x \)
\item Number of mangos = \( \frac{2}{12}x \)
\end{itemize}

Adding these fractions gives:
\[
\frac{3}{12}x + \frac{4}{12}x + \frac{2}{12}x = \frac{9}{12}x
\]
Thus, the number of bananas is:
\[
x - \frac{9}{12}x = \frac{3}{12}x = \frac{1}{4}x
\]

The total number of fruits must be a multiple of the least common multiple of the denominators (4, 3, and 6), which is 12. Therefore, possible values for \( x \) could be 12, 24, 36, etc."

Ellas ven que el centro comercial est√° muy decorado. En todos lados hay muchas personas. Hay much√≠simas personas. Hay ni√±os, adultos e incluso mascotas. Roc√≠o, una de las amigas de Ariana, sabe muy bien que quiere comprar. Ella quiere comprar un vestido largo. El vestido que ella quiere comprar cuesta m√°s de 200 d√≥lares pero hoy d√≠a, debido a los descuentos, ese vestido ahora cuesta s√≥lo 50 d√≥lares. Por ello, Roc√≠o va a la tienda de ropa lo m√°s r√°pido que puede. En realidad, ella corre hacia la tienda. Ariana y Fabiana tienen que seguirla si no quieren quedarse solas. Cuando Roc√≠o llega a la tienda, ella ve que hay muchas personas dentro de la tienda de ropa. Ella no sabe qu√© hacer. Ella ve el vestido que quiere. El vestido que ella quiere viene en varios colores. ¬øCu√°l color le quedar√° mejor? Para saber qu√© color le queda mejor, ella se prueba todos los vestidos que hay disponibles. Fabiana y Ariana se quedan sentadas esper√°ndola afuera de los probadores. Ellas no pueden creer cu√°nto tiempo le toma a Roc√≠o decidirse por un color de vestido. Al final, ella no sabe qu√© color escoger y le pregunta a sus amigas. ¬øQu√© es lo que ellas dicen? Ellas le dicen que ella debe comprar el vestido de color azul. A ella le encanta la idea y se lo compra. Ahora s√≥lo falta pagar por el vestido. Felizmente, Roc√≠o tiene su tarjeta de cr√©dito. Si ella usa su tarjeta de cr√©dito, ella tendr√° incluso m√°s descuentos disponibles. Ariana quiere comprar un cargador de celular. ¬øD√≥nde puede conseguir un cargador de celular? En la tienda de electr√≥nicos, ¬°por supuesto! Como Fabiana tambi√©n quiere comprar unos nuevos aud√≠fonos, ella decide ir con ella. ¬øQu√© hay de Roc√≠o? Ella no quiere ir porque piensa que ir a la tienda de electr√≥nicos es muy aburrido. Por ello, Roc√≠o se queda tomando un caf√© cerca de la tienda de ropa. Ariana encuentra el cargador que quiere, pero desafortunadamente, ese cargador no tiene ning√∫n descuento. Lo bueno es que ella al menos no necesitar√° gastar mucho dinero ya que ese cargador no est√° tan caro. Fabiana, por su parte, va a buscar los aud√≠fonos que ella quiere comprar. Ella vio los aud√≠fonos que quiere comprar en televisi√≥n. Son muy caros pero ella piensa que ahora de seguro el precio habr√° bajado debido a los descuentos. Fabiana estaba en lo cierto. ¬°Los aud√≠fonos que ella quiere comprar no cuestan casi nada! Fabiana no lo piensa mucho y los compra de inmediato. La √∫nica persona que no compra nada es Ariana. A pesar de que el cargador de celular que ella encontr√≥ es barato, ella no lo quiere comprar porque no tiene suficiente dinero. Lo bueno de tener amigas es que, a veces, ellas te ayudan si t√∫ necesitas algo. En este caso, Ariana necesitaba dinero para comprar el cargador y sus amigas quieren ayudarla a compr√°rselo.

Give me a reading comprehension exercise for a student learning French. It should have a subsection for answers.,"C'√©tait calme et silencieux chez les Walter, mis √† part les sons de claquement de fourchettes contre les plats. \\
Toute la famille √©tait r√©unie pour savourer leur d√©jeuner ensemble et bien qu'ils parl√®rent √† certains moments, ils √©taient principalement concentr√©s sur leurs assiettes. \\

Jayden, le membre le plus jeune de la famille, prit un morceau de carotte avec sa fourchette et le regarda curieusement. \\
√áa n'avait pas un mauvais go√ªt et il n'avait jamais eu de probl√®mes pour manger ses l√©gumes mais il ne les trouvait pas aussi bons que du chocolat ou des bonbons. \\

\textit{-Est-ce qu'il y a un probl√®me avec ta nourriture, mon grand ?} demanda son p√®re qui avait pr√©par√© le d√©jeuner ce jour-l√† en le voyant regarder le morceau de carotte. \\
\textit{-Non. Tout est bon,} Jayden dit en mettant le morceau de l√©gume dans sa bouche. \\

\textit{-Pourquoi regardais-tu tes carottes comme √ßa, alors ?} demanda sa m√®re. \\
Le petit gar√ßon haussa ses √©paules avec nonchalance. \\
\textit{-C'est juste que je ne comprends pas.} Sa r√©ponse vague n'√©claircit rien pour ses parents et son p√®re lui demanda ce qu'il ne comprenait pas exactement. \\

Jayden finit de m√¢cher sa nourriture avant de r√©pondre. \\
\textit{-Eh bien, pourquoi devons-nous manger des l√©gumes et de la viande et des p√¢tes et tout quand on peut manger des trucs bons au lieu de √ßa ?} \\

\textit{-Tu ne trouves pas que les p√¢tes sont bonnes ? J'ai cru que tu aimais les spaghetti aux boulettes de viande,} son p√®re lui dit. \\
\textit{Tu avais dit que c'√©tait bon la derni√®re fois que nous en avons mang√©.} \\
\textit{-Ouais, ce n'est pas mal, je crois...} Il soupira avant de prendre un peu de brocoli de son assiette et de le manger. \\

Ses parents se regard√®rent avant que sa m√®re ne lui demande ce qu'il voulait dire par des trucs bons. \\
\textit{-Eh bien, tu sais...} Il posa sa fourchette et regarda ses parents. \\
\textit{Des barres de chocolat et des sucettes et des bonbons. Des trucs bons comme √ßa. Pourquoi ne pouvons-nous pas en manger √† chaque repas ? On n'en mange qu'en tant que g√¢teries et lors des f√™tes.} \\

\textit{-Eh bien, c'est parce qu'ils ne sont pas tr√®s nutritifs,} son p√®re lui dit. \\

Jayden ne savait pas ce que ‚Äúnutritifs‚Äù voulait dire et fixa son p√®re du regard. \\
Celui-ci re√ßut le message et commen√ßa √† expliquer en termes plus simples. \\
\textit{-Tu n'auras pas de vitamines ni de prot√©ines en mangeant des bonbons. Ce n'est en r√©alit√© que du sucre... et il y a aussi du gras dans le chocolat et quelques autres sortes de bonbons.} \\

\textit{-Je croyais que le sucre nous donne de l'√©nergie,} Jayden dit en retour. \\
\textit{-Eh bien, c'est vrai, mais seulement en petites quantit√©s.} \\

\textit{Et il y a aussi quelques types de sucre plus complexes qui nous donnent de l'√©nergie de fa√ßon meilleure et tu peux en trouver dans les pommes de terre et les p√¢tes.} \\

La maman de Jayden lui expliqua en montrant son assiette du doigt. \\
Il regarda la part de pur√©e de pommes de terre qui √©tait dans son assiette et en prit une bouch√©e avant de retourner son attention vers ses parents. \\

\textit{-Haylee prend ces pilules qui contiennent des vitamines √† l'int√©rieur,} dit-il en pointant sa fourchette sur sa grande s≈ìur. \\
\textit{Pourquoi on n'en prend pas √† la place des l√©gumes ? Comme √ßa on aura des vitamines et on gardera de la place dans nos ventres pour les bonbons ?} \\

\textit{-Eh bien, ces pilules s'appellent des suppl√©ments et elles ne sont utilis√©es que pour t'aider.} \\
\textit{Haylee mange quand m√™me tous ses l√©gumes et sa nourriture, n'est-ce pas ?} sa m√®re r√©pondit. \\

\textit{-Oui, je suppose...} \\

\textit{-Et les suppl√©ments ne contiennent pas beaucoup de fibres. Les fibres sont tr√®s importantes parce qu'elles aident ton ventre √† dig√©rer ta nourriture.} \\
\textit{Si tu ne manges pas assez de fibres, tu peux avoir des maux d'estomac,} son p√®re ajouta. \\

\textit{-Et m√™me quand tu manges ta nourriture, tu peux quand m√™me avoir mal au ventre en mangeant trop de bonbons et de sucreries.} \\
\textit{Tu te rappelles de la fois o√π tu avais mang√© la moiti√© du g√¢teau d'anniversaire de Grand-m√®re ?} sa m√®re demanda en arquant son sourcil. \\

Jayden fit une grimace en se rappelant du souvenir. \\
Non seulement il avait eu terriblement mal au ventre, mais il avait d√ª boire un horrible sirop amer pour se remettre de son malaise. \\
\textit{Beurk ! Oui. Je m'en rappelle.} \\

\textit{-Et les bonbons te font grossir !} sa grande s≈ìur lui dit. \\

C'√©tait la premi√®re fois qu'elle avait parl√© depuis le d√©but de la conversation. \\
Jayden fron√ßa ses sourcils et la regarda curieusement. \\
Comment √©tait-il possible pour un tout petit morceau de caramel de faire grossir qui que ce soit ? \\

Il regarda son assiette qui √©tait encore √† moiti√© pleine. \\
Si quelque chose avait le potentiel de faire grossir les gens, √ßa devrait √™tre les immenses quantit√©s de nourriture qu'ils mangeaient √† chaque repas. \\

\textit{-Je crois que les p√¢tes et la pur√©e de pommes de terre peuvent te rendre encore plus gros que les bonbons...} r√©pondit-il. \\

\textit{-Tu as besoin de glucides et tu peux en avoir en mangeant des p√¢tes, des pommes de terre et du pain ainsi que des aliments semblables et ton corps prend un peu de temps pour les transformer en sucre,} \\
\textit{et donc tu ne grossis pas en les mangeant sauf si tu en manges plus que tu n'es cens√©.} \\

\textit{Les l√©gumes ne contiennent pas beaucoup de sucre, et la viande n'en contient pas du tout.} \\
\textit{Mais les bonbons sont purement faits en sucre et √† part si tu es en train de faire des activit√©s qui br√ªlent ce sucre rapidement, ton corps va le garder sous forme de gras.} \\

\textit{En y pensant, manger √©quilibr√© t'aide √† rester en forme parce que tu remplis ton ventre avec des choses qui sont bonnes pour ton corps et tu te sens rassasi√© et du coup tu ne grignotes pas en mangeant des bonbons.} \\

Dit-elle en lui pin√ßant la joue joyeusement. \\
\textit{-Je comprends que les p√¢tes et les pommes de terre me donnent de l'√©nergie et que les l√©gumes gardent mon ventre en bonne sant√©, mais quel est l'int√©r√™t de la viande ?} le petit gar√ßon demanda, sur un ton qui d√©fia ses parents. \\

Bon, il avoua que la viande avait un bon go√ªt en quelque sorte, mais ce n'√©tait pas mieux que les bonbons. \\

\textit{-La viande t'aide √† grandir. Les gens ayant des muscles impressionnants mangent beaucoup de viande, des poissons et des ≈ìufs pour avoir des prot√©ines.} \\
\textit{Tout comme le lait aide tes os √† devenir plus forts, la viande aide tes muscles aussi,} son p√®re r√©pondit en pliant son bras pour montrer son biceps √† Jayden. \\

Bon, Jay devait admettre que l'id√©e d'avoir des muscles comme ceux de son p√®re √©tait vraiment cool et il voulait grandir et devenir fort comme lui. \\
Il regarda son assiette, prit sa fourchette et recommen√ßa √† manger. \\

Une fois qu'il eut fini son assiette, il regarda son p√®re et demanda : \\
\textit{-Alors, on mange quoi pour le dessert ?} \\

Tous les membres de la famille qui √©taient √† table secou√®rent leur t√™te affectueusement. \\
\textit{-Une salade de fruits,} son p√®re lui dit et l'expression d√©√ßue de Jayden fit rire tout le monde.

Give me a reading comprehension exercise for a student learning French. It should have a subsection for answers.,"Un beau jour, dans une cabane perch√©e dans un arbre, un groupe d'enfants √©tait rassembl√© pour passer la journ√©e ensemble. Amis depuis leur plus jeune √¢ge, ils allaient tous √† la m√™me √©cole et passaient leur temps libre les uns avec les autres. Ce jour-l√†, ils √©taient chez Herv√©. Celui-ci, allong√© sur le dos, un bras sous la t√™te, semblait pensif. Un moment plus tard, il se redressa pour prendre une position assise et dit √† ses amis :\\

-- Vous vous rappelez de la f√™te d'anniversaire d'Aur√©lie ?\\

-- Je ne pense pas qu'on soit pr√™ts de l'oublier de sit√¥t, r√©pondit Capucine en posant son livre d'histoire avant de se tourner vers lui.\\

-- C'√©tait la f√™te la plus amusante de ma vie ! remarqua Aude avec un sourire.\\

-- Oui ! s'√©cria Marcel. Il y avait tellement de jeux ! On pouvait jouer sur le trampoline et m√™me aller dans la piscine !\\

-- Et il y avait tant de bonnes choses √† manger ! ajouta Cyril avec un sourire r√™veur.\\

-- Tu parles de la pinata ou des coupes de glace ? lui demanda Aude avec un sourire taquin.\\

-- Je pense qu'on est tous d'accord que la pizza g√©ante √©tait la star du buffet, dit Herv√©.\\

-- Mais j'y pense, comment fait-on une pizza aussi grande ?\\

Les autres enfants prirent un moment pour r√©fl√©chir √† la question de Capucine, mais Aude fut la premi√®re √† r√©pondre en disant que son p√®re lui avait expliqu√© que les choses g√©antes √©taient faites avec des pi√®ces assembl√©es dans une usine.\\

-- Je suppose que c'est logique, vu que la pizza avait quatre parties avec des garnitures diff√©rentes, dit Marcel en hochant la t√™te. Ma partie pr√©f√©r√©e √©tait celle avec la garniture poulet-champignons, miam ! Vous imaginez si on essayait d'en faire une nous-m√™mes ? demanda Cyril avec enthousiasme.\\

√Ä ces mots, les quatre autres commenc√®rent √† r√™vasser. Ils furent transport√©s de leur petite cabane en bois √† une grande usine sophistiqu√©e, pleine de machines et de mat√©riaux.\\

-- On va commencer par diviser les t√¢ches, dit Herv√©. Capucine et Cyril feront la p√¢te, Aude et Marcel pr√©pareront la sauce, et moi, je r√¢perai le fromage. Quand on aura fini, on laissera lever les quartiers de p√¢te, puis on fera cuire les diff√©rentes garnitures, assemblera la pizza, mettra la sauce, la garniture et le fromage, et cuira chaque partie dans un four diff√©rent. Une fois toutes les parties pr√™tes, on assemble le tout !\\

Les autres accept√®rent le plan d'Herv√©, sauf Cyril, qui leva la main et dit :\\

-- Je voudrais r√¢per le fromage √† ta place, et toi, tu peux faire la p√¢te avec Capucine.\\

-- Pas question ! dit Aude. Tu mangerais la moiti√© du fromage si on te laissait faire.\\

Herv√©, Capucine et Marcel rirent tandis que Cyril boudait en murmurant que ce n'√©tait pas juste. Les cinq mirent des tabliers, des gants et des coiffes de cuisinier, puis se dispers√®rent chacun dans leur coin.\\

Capucine demanda √† Cyril de lui chercher la farine et la levure pendant qu'elle chauffait un peu d'eau. Elle versa la levure dans l'eau ti√®de avec un peu de sucre tandis que Cyril lui ramena l'huile et le sel.\\

-- H√©, Capucine, regarde ! dit Cyril avant de lui mettre de la farine sur le nez lorsqu'elle releva la t√™te pour le regarder.\\

-- H√© !!!\\

Elle lui rendit la pareille, et les deux √©clat√®rent de rire avant de se remettre au travail. Ils mirent les ingr√©dients dans le p√©trin, puis pos√®rent le bol pr√®s du four pr√©chauff√©.\\

Pendant ce temps, Aude et Marcel pr√©paraient la sauce.\\

-- Pourquoi on doit y mettre du sucre ? demanda Marcel.\\

-- Pour neutraliser l'acidit√© de la tomate, r√©pondit la fillette.\\

-- Est-ce qu'on a vraiment besoin de toutes ces √©pices ?\\

-- Oui, c'est ce qui donne un bon go√ªt √† la sauce.\\

-- On peut se passer de l'ail, tu ne crois pas ? dit Marcel avec un air incertain.\\

Aude le regarda, puis regarda la grande marmite contenant la sauce.\\

-- Tu n'aimes pas l'ail ?\\

-- Non, je trouve √ßa un peu fort.\\

Ils √©chang√®rent un regard complice, et Aude haussa les √©paules avant de poser l'ail sur la table.\\

-- √áa ne fera de mal √† personne s'il manque un ingr√©dient, hein ? dit-elle avec un sourire.\\

-- Personne n'a besoin de savoir qu'il manque un ingr√©dient d'ailleurs, r√©pondit Marcel.\\

Ils se serr√®rent la main puis continu√®rent leur travail : Aude ajoutait les ingr√©dients tandis que Marcel remuait la sauce sur le feu.\\

De l'autre c√¥t√© de l'usine, Herv√© r√¢pait le fromage et, un peu comme Cyril l'aurait fait, prit soin de le go√ªter.\\

-- Juste pour v√©rifier si c'est de la bonne qualit√©‚Ä¶ se dit-il.\\

Lorsque toutes les t√¢ches principales furent accomplies, le groupe d'enfants passa √† la cuisson des garnitures. Cyril insista pour une partie poulet-champignons, Aude et Capucine voulaient des poivrons et du pepperoni, Herv√© opta pour une garniture italienne avec basilic, olives et mozzarella, et Marcel surprit tout le monde en choisissant de mettre de l'ananas dans une partie.\\

-- √Ä chacun sa tasse ! dit-il.\\

Ils firent cuire le tout avant de mettre la sauce, la garniture et le fromage sur les quartiers de p√¢te, puis transf√©r√®rent les morceaux au four sur un grand chariot. Lorsqu'une d√©licieuse odeur emplit l'usine, indiquant que les parties de pizza √©taient pr√™tes, ils les sortirent prudemment, les mirent un √† un sur un grand plan de travail, puis les pouss√®rent c√¥te √† c√¥te pour former un grand disque de pizza.\\

Ils se regard√®rent, fatigu√©s, souriants, et surtout fiers de leur travail.\\

-- Qui a faim ?\\

Une voix m√©lodieuse interrompit le r√™ve √©veill√© des cinq enfants. Herv√© se tourna vers sa m√®re, perch√©e sur l'escalier de la cabane.\\

-- √áa vous dit d'aller manger au resto rapide ? leur demanda-t-elle.\\

Les cinq amis accept√®rent l'offre avec enthousiasme et lui dirent qu'ils savaient d√©j√† ce qu'ils voulaient : une pizza !\\

La raison pour laquelle Cindy faisait la t√™te √©tait assez simple : elle √©tait frustr√©e car elle avait eu une tr√®s bonne id√©e ‚Äî ou, du moins, elle avait cru que c'√©tait le cas ‚Äî qui avait mal tourn√© quand elle avait essay√© de l'ex√©cuter. \\
Son id√©e n'√©tait pas quelque chose de vraiment compliqu√©. C'√©tait m√™me une id√©e tr√®s simple. \\
Elle avait pens√© que si elle nouait ses lacets et courait √† travers son jardin, elle pourrait s'entra√Æner seule pour la course √† trois jambes de son √©cole. \\
Malheureusement, son id√©e √©choua et quand elle tenta de prendre le premier pas, elle finit par tomber. \\
Ses coudes √©taient √©gratign√©s et sa fiert√© √©tait touch√©e par l'√©chec de l'id√©e qu'elle avait cru √™tre brillante. \\
Quelle honte ! \\

\textit{-√áa aurait √©t√© super si les id√©es pouvaient nous pr√©venir d'avance et nous dire si elles sont de bonnes ou de mauvaises id√©es...} murmura-t-elle √† elle-m√™me avec un soupir malheureux. \\
Selon elle, cela l'aurait √©pargn√©e. Ou du moins, ses coudes auraient √©t√© √©pargn√©s. \\

Elle commen√ßa √† r√™vasser en pensant √† cette id√©e. \\
\textit{-Si ma mauvaise id√©e √©tait devenue une personne pour me pr√©venir en avance, elle aurait eu une apparence affreuse...} dit-elle en imaginant une petite version d'elle-m√™me habill√©e en pyjama sale. \\
La ""mauvaise"" id√©e avait les cheveux en l'air et du sable dans les yeux, n'ayant clairement pas fait sa toilette du matin. \\

\textit{-Je parie que tu ne t'es m√™me pas bross√©e les dents...} Cindy lui dit. \\
\textit{-Pourquoi faire ? Je ne vais rien accomplir de toute fa√ßon.} La petite id√©e-Cindy r√©pondit en baillant. \\
\textit{-Beurk ! J'avais raison, tu as une haleine de chacal !} Cindy l'accusa en agitant sa main devant son nez. \\

L'id√©e sourit et agita la main avec audace avant de dispara√Ætre. \\
\textit{-Ce n'est pas √©tonnant qu'elle ait √©chou√©,} pensa-t-elle. \textit{J'aurais pu deviner si j'avais vu √† quoi elle ressemblait...} \\

Avec un soupir, elle d√©cida de se d√©gourdir les jambes et se leva pour le faire. \\
En descendant les marches, elle pensa √† la premi√®re personne qui avait pens√© √† les construire. \\
Elle ne connaissait pas qui avait invent√© les marches et donc elle imagina que c'√©tait elle, et une petite vision d'elle apparut devant elle. \\

\textit{-Salut, petite moi !} salua-t-elle. \\
La petite id√©e avait une belle apparence. Elle √©tait habill√©e convenablement mais ses v√™tements n'√©taient pas tr√®s sophistiqu√©s, c'√©tait seulement une salopette en jean avec un T-shirt en coton en dessous. \\
Elle √©tait propre et ses cheveux √©taient bross√©s et tenus en queue de cheval. \\
Elle sourit timidement et fit un signe de la main en guise de salut. \\

\textit{-La conception des marches √©tait une id√©e simple mais tr√®s bonne. Cela a permis aux gens de monter √† de hauts endroits apr√®s qu'ils avaient eu des difficult√©s avec les pentes raides,} l'id√©e l'informa avec un sourire confiant. \\
Cindy hocha la t√™te. \\
\textit{-C'√©tait s√ªrement une bonne id√©e vu qu'on l'utilise jusqu'√† ce jour.} \\

Une autre id√©e apparut devant elle et s'√©claircit la gorge. \\
\textit{-L'ascenseur √©tait une id√©e encore meilleure,} dit-elle avec une expression hautaine. \\
Celle-ci √©tait habill√©e en costume parfaitement repass√© et portait des lunettes. \\
Ses cheveux √©taient coiff√©s en un chignon qui rappela √† Cindy la directrice de son √©cole. \\
\textit{-Tr√®s pratique pour les gens avec des handicaps et permet de gagner du temps. D'ailleurs, les gens n'ont qu'√† appuyer sur quelques boutons,} l'id√©e ajouta. \\

Avant que Cindy n'e√ªt le temps de r√©pondre, l'id√©e-escalier prit la parole. \\
\textit{-Oui, m-mais inutile sans √©lectricit√©,} elle argumenta en levant son index. \\
L'id√©e-ascenseur laissa √©chapper un souffle et parut tr√®s offens√©e. \\
\textit{-De nos jours, les coupures de courant sont tr√®s rares,} r√©pondit-elle en croisant les bras. \\

\textit{-Pas aussi rares que √ßa dans certains pays. Je suis s√ªre qu'ils sont contents d'avoir des escaliers.} Telle √©tait la r√©ponse de l'id√©e-escalier. \\
Cindy rigola en regardant les deux id√©es se chamailler sur laquelle d'entre elles √©tait la plus r√©volutionnaire jusqu'√† ce que les deux disparurent avec un son de ""pouf"" en laissant un nuage de poussi√®re color√©e derri√®re elles. \\

Elle continua √† marcher sans destination en t√™te √† travers le jardin et s'arr√™ta quand elle vit un nain de jardin. \\
Cindy inclina la t√™te sur le c√¥t√© et le regarda avec confusion. \\
C'√©tait l'une des id√©es dont elle ne pouvait pas se r√©signer. √Ä quoi pensait la personne qui les avait invent√©s ? \\

Soudain, une autre id√©e apparut devant elle. Celle-l√† portait une jupe, un tricot en laine et une paire de mocassins. \\
Ses cheveux √©taient en cascade et elle regarda autour d'elle, distraite par son entourage. \\
\textit{-Salut...?} Cindy la salua avec h√©sitation. \\
\textit{-Es-tu cens√©e √™tre une bonne ou mauvaise id√©e ?} \\

L'id√©e haussa ses √©paules et sourit. \\
\textit{-Je suis l'id√©e-naine-de-jardin. Je n'√©tais qu'une pens√©e impulsive, rien de trop sophistiqu√©.} \\
\textit{-Eh bien, comment celui qui t'a invent√©e a su que tu allais devenir populaire ?} Cindy demanda. \\

L'id√©e sourit et secoua la t√™te. \\
\textit{-Il ne le savait pas. Il m'a juste appliqu√©e en esp√©rant avoir un bon r√©sultat. Certaines choses dans la vie marchent ainsi, le sais-tu ? Tu dois tenter ta chance et voir ce qui va se passer !} \\

Cindy regarda l'id√©e en face. Elle n'y avait pas pens√© ainsi. \\
Elle pensa que cette approche allait lui √©viter des d√©ceptions. \\
Si quelqu'un essaie quelque chose sans penser √† sa r√©ussite ou son √©chec, il ne serait pas d√©√ßu en cas d'√©chec. \\
D'autre part, si l'id√©e r√©ussit, il aurait une bonne surprise. \\

\textit{-Eh bien, je dois y aller ! √Ä plus tard !} l'id√©e-naine-de-jardin dit avant de dispara√Ætre. \\
Cindy scruta l'endroit o√π l'id√©e √©tait avant qu'un sourire n'appar√ªt lentement sur son visage. \\
\textit{-Je crois qu'il est temps de r√©fl√©chir √† quelques id√©es...} se dit-elle en courant √† sa chambre pour commencer √† planifier sa prochaine id√©e.

Give me a combination of a reading exercise and a comprehension exercise for a student learning German. It should have a subsection for answers.,"Ein erfolgreicher Gesch√§ftsmann wurde √§lter und erkannte, dass jemand ihn ersetzen sollte. Anstatt einige seiner Kollegen oder jemanden aus seiner Familie auszuw√§hlen, entschied er sich, etwas Ungew√∂hnliches zu tun. Er lud alle potenziellen Kandidaten, Finanzdirektoren, Abteilungsleiter, Kassierer, Berater, ein und gab ihnen die folgende Rede:\\
\textit{One successful businessman was getting older and realized that someone should replace him. Instead of choosing some of his colleagues or someone from his family, he decided to do something unusual. He invited all potential candidates, financial directors, chiefs of departments, cashiers, and advisors and gave them the following speech:}\\

""Liebe Freunde, es ist Zeit f√ºr mich, mein Gesch√§ft zu beenden und in einen verdienten Ruhestand zu gehen. Au√üerdem ist es jetzt die beste Zeit, einen neuen Gesch√§ftsf√ºhrer auszuw√§hlen, der unser Unternehmen in Zukunft leiten wird ... Ich habe mich entschieden, dass es einer von euch sein wird. ""\\
\textit{""Dear friends, it's time for me to finish my business and go to a deserved retirement. Also, now is the best time to choose a new general manager who will lead our company in the future. I decided that it would be one of you.""}\\

Die jungen potenziellen Chefs waren verwirrt ...\\
\textit{The young prospective bosses were confused ...}\\

""Ich werde jedem von euch einen Samen geben. Dies ist ein ganz besonderer Samen. Ich will, dass ihr ihn alle pflanzt und gie√üt, und n√§chstes Jahr wieder zur√ºckbringt, um zu sehen, was ihr damit gemacht habt. Dann werde ich entscheiden, wer der neue Gesch√§ftsf√ºhrer sein wird. ""\\
\textit{""I will give each of you one seed. This is a very special seed. I want all of you to plant it and water it and we will gather again next year to see what you did with it. Then I will decide who will be the new manager. ""}\\

Jim war auch bei diesem Treffen dabei, und wie auch alle anderen die anwesend waren, bekam er einen Samen. Als er nach Hause kam, teilte er die Nachricht mit seiner Frau und sie beschlossen, den Samen zu n√§hren, aus dem die Pflanze wachsen w√ºrde. Sie fanden einen sch√∂nen Topf, legten den D√ºnger und einen Thermometer ein, haben ein paar B√ºcher √ºber Pflanzenanbau gelesen und fuhren mit ihrem Leben fort. Jeden Tag gingen sie zu dem Topf und warteten gespannt darauf, dass etwas auftaucht.\\
\textit{Jim was also at this meeting, and as everyone else present, he got the seed, too. When he arrived home, he shared the message with his wife and they decided to nurture the seed from which the plant would grow. They found a nice pot, put the fertilizer, took a thermometer, read a few books on plant cultivation, and continued with their lives. Every day they went to the pot and eagerly waited for something to emerge.}\\ 

Nach 14 Tagen haben einige von Jims Kollegen bereits angefangen, √ºber ihre wachsenden Pflanzen zu sprechen. Und Jim beobachtete den Topf jeden Tag mit seiner Frau, aber nichts passierte. Es ist √ºber ein Monat vergangen und nichts ist passiert. √úber die Pflanzen wurde schon viel diskutiert.\\ 
\textit{After 14 days, some of Jim's colleagues had already started talking about their growing plants. And Jim watched with his wife every day, but nothing happened. It had been over a month and nothing happened. There had already been a lot of discussion about the plants.}\\ 

Zur Mittagszeit tauschten sie praktische Ideen √ºber schnellen Wachstum aus, und Jim erkannte, dass er als einziger keinen Erfolg hatte.\\ 
\textit{At lunch-time, they exchanged practical ideas of rapid growth, and Jim realized that he was alone with nothing and that he was unsuccessful.}\\ 

Sechs Monate sp√§ter, und es gab immer noch keine Fortschritte. Er begann zu glauben, dass er einen Fehler gemacht hatte. Vielleicht zu viel Wasser oder schlechter D√ºnger oder etwas anderes, das er nicht erkl√§ren konnte. Er wusste, dass er sein Bestes gab und es tat ihm leid, dass er keine Ergebnisse hatte.\\ 
\textit{Six months later, and there was still no progress. He began to believe that he had made a mistake. Maybe too much water or bad fertilizer or something else that he could not explain. He knew he did the best he could and was sorry he had no results.}\\ 

Das Jahr ging bald zu Ende, und die jungen Bosse versammelten sich mit ihren Pflanzen, um den Gesch√§ftsf√ºhrer zu treffen. Jim sagte seiner Frau, dass er den leeren Topf nicht mitnehmen w√ºrde, aber sie schaffte es, ihn zu √ºberreden, um den Manager zu erz√§hlen, was passiert war. Er war sehr nerv√∂s.\\ 
\textit{The year soon came to an end, and the young bosses gathered together with their plants to meet the general manager. Jim told his wife that he would not take the empty pot, but she, however, managed to persuade him, telling him to tell the manager fairly what had happened. He was very nervous.}\\ 

Er dachte, dass dies der unangenehmste Moment f√ºr ihn im Leben sein wird. Trotzdem wusste sie, dass sie Recht hatte und war fest davon √ºberzeugt, dass er nichts falsch gemacht hatte. Er nahm seinen Topf mit in den Besprechungsraum. Er sah wundersch√∂ne Pflanzen auf dem Tisch. Sie waren alle gro√ü und ausgewachsen.\\ 
\textit{He thought that this would be the most unpleasant moment for him in life. Still, she knew she was right and was firmly convinced that there was nothing he did wrong. He took his pot in the meeting room. He saw beautiful plants on the table. They were all big and fully grown.}\\ 

Er stellte seinen leeren Topf auf den Boden, w√§hrend andere lachten. Als der Gesch√§ftsf√ºhrer ankam, schaute er durch alle Pflanzen und begr√º√üte die Kandidaten. Jim versuchte, so weit von ihm entfernt zu sein, damit er es nicht sehen w√ºrde.\\ 
\textit{He put his empty pot on the floor, while others were laughing. When the general manager arrived, he looked through all the plants and greeted the candidates. Jim tried to be as far away from him, so that he would not see it.}\\ 

""Wie sch√∂n!"" sagte der Gesch√§ftsf√ºhrer. ""Ich sehe, dass es jetzt nicht einfach sein wird, einen neuen Manager auszuw√§hlen ..."" Und in diesem Moment sah er den leeren Topf. Er hat den Vizepr√§sidenten gebeten, ihn zu nehmen und den Eigent√ºmer zu ihm zu bringen. Jim trat heraus.\\ 
\textit{""How beautiful!"" the general manager said. ""I see that it will not be easy to pick a new manager now ..."" And, at that moment, he saw the empty pot. He asked the vice president to take it and bring the owner to him. Jim stepped out.}\\ 

""Oh Gott ... Vielleicht werde ich jetzt rausgeschmissen"", dachte er.\\ 
\textit{""Oh God ... Maybe I'll get kicked out of the company now,"" he thought.}\\ 

Als er kam, fragte ihn der Manager, was mit seinem Samen passierte. Und Jim war ganz ehrlich und er entschuldigte sich. Der Manager bat dann alle sich zu sitzen - au√üer Jim. Er sah sie an und sagte:\\ 
\textit{When he came, the general manager asked him what happened to his seed. And Jim was all honest and he apologized. The general manager then asked everyone to sit - except for Jim. He looked at them and said:}\\ 

""Jim, ich bin sehr stolz auf dich ... Jim ist der neue CEO der Firma!""\\ 
\textit{""Jim, I'm very proud of you. Jim is the new CEO of the company!""}\\ 

""Nun ... wie ist das m√∂glich? Mein Topf ist leer ..."", fragte Jim verwirrt.\\ 
\textit{""Well ... how is that possible? My pot is empty. "" Jim asked confused.}\\ 

Der alte Manager erkl√§rte: ""Vor einem Jahr gab ich jedem von euch einen toten Samen. Es war unm√∂glich, dass etwas daraus w√§chst. Jeder von euch, der sah, dass nichts passierte, beschloss es durch gesunde Samen zu ersetzen. Jeder von euch - Au√üer Jim. Ihr alle habt mir Pflanzen und Blumen gebracht. Nur Jim war stolz auf das Versagen und hatte genug Mut und Ehrlichkeit, mir einen leeren Topf zu bringen. Ihr wolltet Erfolg - um jeden Preis, und Jims Ehrlichkeit war wichtiger als Erfolg. Deshalb ist er heute der CEO ... ""\\ 
\textit{The old general manager explained: ""One year ago I gave each of you a dead seed. It was impossible that something could grow out of it. Each of you, seeing nothing to grow, decided to replace it with healthy seeds. Each of you - except Jim. You all brought me plants and flowers. Only Jim was proud of the failure and had enough courage and honesty to bring me an empty seed. You all wanted success - at all cost, and Jim's honesty was more important than success. That is why he is the CEO today. ""}

The exercise should contain some kind of a graphic component (illustration, diagram, table, etc). It should be an exercise on story continuation.","The three hobbits, Merry, Pippin, and Frodo, found themselves deep in the heart of a dark and twisted forest. The trees loomed high above them, their branches tangled like fingers clawing at the sky. Shadows flickered all around, and even the faintest sounds seemed louder, echoing eerily among the trunks.

Merry, always the cheerful one, tried to keep everyone‚Äôs spirits up. Though he was feeling uncertain, he whistled softly to himself as they walked, hoping his calmness might rub off on the others. Occasionally, he caught a glimpse of what he thought was a path, and he felt a little surge of relief every time they seemed to be going in the right direction.

But Pippin was struggling. The darkness, the strange sounds, and the constant feeling of being lost gnawed at him. At one point, he couldn‚Äôt hold back his frustration anymore. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt bear it!‚Äù he shouted, breaking the silence and startling the others. It felt as though the trees were closing in on him, and he began to doubt whether they‚Äôd ever find their way out.

Frodo, leading the way, tried to stay hopeful, though doubts were creeping into his mind. Every turn looked the same, and after a while, he began to wonder if they were going in circles. ‚ÄúWhat if there‚Äôs no way through?‚Äù he murmured to himself, his voice barely audible. But he kept moving forward, hoping against hope that they would eventually find an escape.

Then, just as despair began to settle in, Merry caught sight of something up ahead‚Äîa path, winding its way through the trees and leading toward what looked like the edge of the forest. He let out a low whistle of relief, and Frodo and Pippin quickly followed his gaze. Could this be their way out?

Give me a reading comprehension exercise for a student learning French. It should have a subsection for answers.,"Un apr√®s-midi nuageux, alors que la brise soufflait doucement pour apporter un peu de fra√Æcheur, un vieil homme et sa petite-fille entr√®rent dans une boutique de bibelots au bord de la mer. \\
Tandis que le vieil homme alla parler avec le propri√©taire de la boutique qui √©tait son ami, la petite fille profita de l'occasion pour regarder autour d'elle et observer ce qu'il y avait dans la boutique comme articles. \\

Elle admira les diff√©rents petits bibelots qui paraissaient √™tre des souvenirs ramen√©s de voyages √† travers diff√©rents et lointains mondes. \\
Elle vit quelques carillons √©oliens, tous de diff√©rentes couleurs et tailles, ce qui indiquait qu'ils √©taient collectionn√©s √† travers les ann√©es plut√¥t que fournis en gros depuis un stock d'usine. \\
Elle passa les doigts √† travers eux et se d√©tendit en entendant le son de leur doux tintement avant de passer √† l'objet suivant qui attira son attention : les capteurs de r√™ves. \\

Les objets circulaires avaient des filets tiss√©s en diff√©rents motifs et d√©cor√©s avec des perles color√©es ainsi que de tr√®s belles plumes qui √©taient suspendues sur la partie inf√©rieure. \\
Chaque capteur de r√™ves paraissait unique et diff√©rent des autres. \\
Apr√®s qu'elle les eut admir√©s assez longtemps, elle se tourna vers les jolies poup√©es russes qui √©taient mises en valeur sur une √©tag√®re qui leur avait √©t√© d√©di√©e. \\

Elle rigola en voyant √† quel point les poup√©es rondes √©taient mignonnes et sourit avec affection en admirant leurs couleurs. \\
En dessous, il y avait des ≈ìufs de joaillier, √©maill√©s d'or et d'argent et incrust√©s de pierres pr√©cieuses qui brillaient dans la faible lueur. \\
Ils avaient l'air tr√®s chers et elle se demanda ce qu'ils faisaient dans une boutique de bibelots au lieu d'√™tre dans une bijouterie. \\

Cependant, ce qui attira le plus l'attention de la petite fille √©taient les bateaux en bouteilles qui √©taient dans un coin de la boutique. \\
Ils √©taient sur un pr√©sentoir de fa√ßon √† ce que chaque bateau soit sur une √©tag√®re. \\
Certains √©taient plus larges que les autres mais ils inspiraient tous la m√™me √©motion : l'√©merveillement. \\

\textit{-As-tu trouv√© quelque chose qui t'a plu, Aria ?} son grand-p√®re dit de l'autre c√¥t√© du magasin o√π le comptoir se situait. \\
\textit{-Je suis juste en train d'observer !} r√©pondit-elle sans d√©tourner son regard des bateaux en bouteilles. \\
\textit{-Mais, comment... ?} murmura-t-elle. \textit{Comment √©taient-ils faits ?} √âtait-ce ce qu'elle se demandait. \\
Comment est-ce que les gens √©taient arriv√©s √† faire rentrer des bateaux de cette taille dans des bouteilles √† travers leurs petites ouvertures ? \\

Le propri√©taire du magasin et son grand-p√®re se rendirent o√π elle se tenait et tandis que son grand-p√®re serra un bras autour de ses √©paules, l'autre homme prit l'une des bouteilles. \\
\textit{-Tu te demandes comment ils sont faits, n'est-ce pas ?} il questionna avec un doux regard. \\
\textit{-Oui ! Comment avez-vous su ?} Le vieil homme rigola et lui tapota la t√™te tendrement. \\

\textit{-Tout le monde se pose cette question quand ils les voient,} dit-il en lui passant la bouteille. \\

Aria tendit ses mains et lui prit le bateau. Elle le tint au niveau de ses yeux et plissa ceux-ci pour voir tous les d√©tails du bateau. \\
Il √©tait fait en bois et les voiles semblaient √™tre faites en papier. Tout avait l'air r√©el, du nom peint sur le c√¥t√© du bateau au nid de pie sur le point le plus haut. \\

\textit{-Alors... vous savez comment √ßa a √©t√© fait ?} demanda-t-elle curieusement au propri√©taire de la boutique en lui repassant le pr√©cieux objet. \\
Le vieil homme hocha la t√™te et se tourna vers elle apr√®s avoir remis la bouteille √† sa place. \\

\textit{-Certains croient qu'il y a longtemps de cela, quand les marins oubliaient leurs bouteilles ouvertes avant de s'endormir, de toutes petites cr√©atures sortaient de leurs cachettes et construisaient des bateaux qui flottaient sur le liquide qui √©tait dans la bouteille.} \\
\textit{Quand le liquide s√©chait au lever du jour, les cr√©atures disparaissaient apr√®s avoir fini leur t√¢che et seul le bateau restait dans la bouteille, la rendant inutilisable.} \\

\textit{Les marins n'avaient pas d'autres choix que de garder les bateaux en bouteilles pour d√©corer ou les vendre aux touristes.} \\

√âmerveill√©e par la l√©gende, Aria ne dit rien √† travers le r√©cit du vieux vendeur. \\

\textit{-Cependant,} le vieil homme reprit la parole. \\
\textit{-Les humains commenc√®rent √† copier le travail des minuscules √™tres et commenc√®rent √† cr√©er ces mod√®les eux-m√™mes.} \\

\textit{D'ailleurs,} dit-il en regardant son grand-p√®re. \\
\textit{-Ton vieillard sait comment les fabriquer. Tous ces mod√®les ont √©t√© faits par ton grand-p√®re !} \\

Aria laissa √©chapper un souffle et tourna la t√™te pour faire face √† son grand-p√®re. \\
\textit{-Vraiment ?} murmura-t-elle. \\

Grand-p√®re rigola et la serra contre lui. \\
\textit{-En effet. On peut en faire un quand on rentre √† la maison si tu veux,} lui dit-il. \\
\textit{-Oui, s'il te pla√Æt !} dit-elle avec grand enthousiasme. \\

Tenant sa parole, lorsqu'ils retourn√®rent chez lui, grand-p√®re ramena du bois, du papier, de la colle et d'autres mat√©riaux dont ils avaient besoin pour faire le mod√®le. \\
\textit{-Tout d'abord, on va construire la base du bateau,} son grand-p√®re lui dit en prenant un morceau de bois et en commen√ßant √† le sculpter avant de le peindre en marron fonc√©. \\

\textit{-Puis, on commence par le glisser √† l'int√©rieur de la bouteille. On va monter les diff√©rentes pi√®ces du bateau √† l'int√©rieur de la bouteille.} \\
Il fit cela avant de demander √† sa petite fille de dessiner des formes de voiles sur le papier. \\

\textit{-Maintenant, coupe-les pendant que je noue le fil qui va servir de cordes √† la base du bateau.} \\

Les deux travaill√®rent en silence, chacun plong√© dans sa t√¢che et quand il √©tait temps pour la touche finale, grand-p√®re utilisa deux longs crochets en m√©tal pour tirer les fils qui √©taient nou√©s aux voiles et en tirant rapidement sur eux, les voiles s'√©tendirent et l'≈ìuvre fut termin√©e. \\

\textit{-Juste un dernier petit d√©tail,} dit-il en lui passant le bouchon en li√®ge. \\
\textit{-Tu veux bien ?} \\

\textit{-Avec plaisir !} Aria prit la pi√®ce en bois dans sa main et l'ins√©ra dans l'ouverture de la bouteille en verre. \\
\textit{-Voil√†. C'est fini !}

Give me a reading comprehension exercise for a student learning French. It should have a subsection for answers.,"Un beau jour ensoleill√©, les √©l√®ves de la garderie \textit{Le Li√®vre} partirent en randonn√©e dans le bois avec leur institutrice. Celle-ci avait choisi un itin√©raire assez facile pour les tout-petits et marchait √† un rythme lent pour ne pas les fatiguer.\\

-- Zo√© ? Cl√©ment, un des petits gar√ßons qui marchaient en queue, appela sa s≈ìur.\\

-- Oui ? r√©pondit son a√Æn√©e.\\

Zo√© trouvait l'activit√© √† son go√ªt. Depuis toute petite, elle aimait marcher, courir et sauter. C'√©tait une fillette tr√®s active, contrairement √† son petit fr√®re g√¢t√© qui pr√©f√©rait se faire porter.\\

-- J'ai faim. Quand est-ce qu'on va manger ? demanda-t-il.\\

-- On mangera quand on arrivera aux chalets. Mademoiselle Ludivine nous l'a d√©j√† dit.\\

-- Mais j...\\

Avant qu'il ne puisse finir sa phrase, Cl√©ment tr√©bucha sur une pierre et tomba. Il se redressa mais resta agenouill√©, g√©missant de douleur en s'essuyant le visage. Zo√©, exasp√©r√©e par son petit fr√®re √©tourdi, soupira et s'arr√™ta pour l'aider.\\

-- Tu es tomb√© parce que tes lacets sont d√©faits. Regarde ! dit-elle en indiquant ses chaussures d'un mouvement de t√™te.\\

-- Ah ! Une minute, je vais les refaire !\\

Distrait, Cl√©ment cessa de pleurer et se concentra sur ses lacets, mais apr√®s plusieurs tentatives infructueuses, sa grande s≈ìur perdit patience. Elle s'accroupit pour les refaire elle-m√™me.\\

-- Laisse-moi faire, sinon on y passera la journ√©e, dit-elle.\\

Une fois ses chaussures s√©curis√©es, Cl√©ment et sa s≈ìur reprirent leur route pour rejoindre les autres. Mais apr√®s une bonne dizaine de minutes, ils r√©alis√®rent qu'ils s'√©taient s√©par√©s du groupe.\\

-- Ah ! Ils ont avanc√© dr√¥lement vite, dis donc ! remarqua Zo√©.\\

Les deux continu√®rent √† marcher jusqu'√† une bifurcation.\\

-- Tu crois qu'ils sont partis par o√π ? demanda Cl√©ment.\\

-- Je n'en sais rien. Mais on doit choisir.\\

-- Je vais le faire ! r√©pondit son fr√®re.\\

\textit{Am stram gram, pique et pique et col√©gram, bourre et bourre et ratatam, am stram gram !}\\

Il chanta en pointant le doigt sur les deux chemins, puis d√©clara qu'ils iraient √† gauche. Zo√© accepta, et ils se remirent en route. En chemin, Cl√©ment se plaignit de la chaleur, de la fatigue et de la faim. Zo√©, l'ignorant, lui tendit sa gourde.\\

-- Bois un peu d'eau, dit-elle.\\

Ils march√®rent en silence avant que Cl√©ment demande √† nouveau quand ils arriveraient.\\

-- Je n'en sais pas plus que toi, Cl√©ment ! r√©pondit-elle. D'ailleurs, je crois que nous sommes perdus...\\

Cl√©ment, tentant de garder son calme, se rassura en pensant que sa grande s≈ìur, courageuse et intelligente, trouverait une solution.\\

-- Qu'est-ce qu'on va faire maintenant ? demanda-t-il.\\

-- Peut-√™tre qu'on doit rester ici et attendre qu'on nous envoie de l'aide. Mademoiselle Ludivine finira par se rendre compte de notre absence t√¥t ou tard... dit Zo√© avec incertitude.\\

D√©sirant aider, Cl√©ment lui sugg√©ra quelques solutions.\\

-- Peut-√™tre qu'on devrait grimper sur l'arbre le plus haut pour rep√©rer le camp.\\

-- Ce serait trop dangereux, soupira Zo√©.\\

-- Alors, on peut continuer √† marcher jusqu'au sommet de la montagne.\\

-- On ne sait m√™me pas quel chemin prendre pour atteindre le sommet...\\

-- On peut --\\

-- Non, Cl√©ment ! On ne peut rien faire ! Arr√™te de m'agacer ! On va rester ici et attendre que quelqu'un vienne pour nous ! cria Zo√©, √† bout de patience.\\

Vex√© par le ton de sa s≈ìur, Cl√©ment commen√ßa √† pleurer. Zo√©, regrettant son √©clat de col√®re, le prit dans ses bras pour s'excuser.\\

-- Allez, viens, on va manger. Je sais que tu as faim, lui dit-elle en le menant vers une souche.\\

Les deux sortirent leurs bo√Ætes √† lunch et commenc√®rent √† manger. Au bout d'un moment, Cl√©ment aper√ßut un √©cureuil qui les guettait depuis un arbre.\\

-- Je crois qu'il a faim, dit Zo√©.\\

-- Maman nous a mis de la tarte aux noix de p√©can, tu veux lui en offrir un peu ?\\

Cl√©ment, enthousiaste, prit un morceau de tarte et s'approcha doucement de l'animal, qui commen√ßa √† manger dans sa main. Quand tous furent rassasi√©s, une voix les surprit :\\

-- Vous √™tes perdus, n'est-ce pas ?\\

Zo√© et Cl√©ment regard√®rent autour d'eux jusqu'√† ce que la voix leur dise de regarder en bas. Bouche b√©e, ils r√©alis√®rent qu'elle venait de l'√©cureuil.\\

-- I-i-il parle ! cria Cl√©ment.\\

-- C'est exact, dit l'√©cureuil avec un petit sourire espi√®gle.\\

-- Z-Z-Zo√© ! Il parle ! balbutia Cl√©ment, tournant vers sa s≈ìur p√©trifi√©e.\\

L'√©cureuil l√¢cha un soupir, plus ennuy√© qu'amus√© maintenant.\\

-- Mais √©videmment que je parle. Tout le monde parle dans le bois enchant√© !\\

Cela fit enfin sortir Zo√© de son √©tat de transe.\\

-- Le bois enchant√© ? r√©p√©ta-t-elle.\\

-- Comme je viens de le dire, r√©torqua l'animal. Mais j'y pense, je ne me suis pas encore pr√©sent√©. Je m'appelle F√©lix. F√©lix DuBois, ajouta-t-il.\\

Cl√©ment √©clata de rire au jeu de mots, tandis que Zo√© se pr√©senta, elle et son fr√®re.\\

-- Pour vous remercier d'avoir partag√© votre repas avec moi, que diriez-vous si je vous conduisais √† votre troupeau ?\\

-- On a un troupeau ? chuchota Cl√©ment.\\

-- Il parle de nos camarades et de Mademoiselle Ludivine, l'informa Zo√©.\\

-- Alors, qu'en dites-vous ?\\

-- Oui ! Oui... on vous en serait tr√®s reconnaissants, Monsieur DuBois ! dit Zo√© avec un sourire.\\

-- Appelez-moi F√©lix. Monsieur DuBois est mon p√®re, dit-il avant de leur demander de le suivre.\\

Ils march√®rent un moment en silence, puis Cl√©ment commen√ßa √† interroger leur guide.\\

-- Et vous √™tes s√ªr que vous n'avez pas de pouvoirs magiques ? demanda-t-il.\\

-- S√ªr et certain, mon petit, r√©pondit l'√©cureuil patiemment.\\

-- Et les autres habitants du bois ? Est-ce qu'ils en ont ?\\

-- Hmm... eh bien, oui. Certains, comme les vieux ch√™nes, les loups, ou l'aigle.\\

Cl√©ment √©coutait avec des yeux brillants d'√©merveillement. F√©lix continua :\\

-- Le vieux ch√™ne a le pouvoir de gu√©rison. Les animaux bless√©s viennent souvent √† lui pour demander de l'aide. Il est aussi le plus vieux de la for√™t, apr√®s tout.\\

Ils march√®rent encore un peu avant d'atteindre la cascade sacr√©e, l'endroit o√π les animaux se d√©salt√®rent. Ils y virent toutes sortes d'animaux. Cl√©ment, impressionn√©, serra la main de sa s≈ìur.\\

-- C'est bizarre, je ne le vois pas. Il devrait √™tre ici, dit F√©lix. Octave, notre aigle, vient toujours √† cette heure...\\

Une louve au pelage blanc salua F√©lix.\\

-- Bonjour, F√©lix. Toujours aussi radieuse, H√©l√®ne, r√©pondit F√©lix. Aurais-tu vu Octave ?\\

-- Il est malade. Tu le trouveras s√ªrement pr√®s du vieux ch√™ne, dit-elle.\\

F√©lix guida les enfants vers le ch√™ne.\\

-- Bonjour, Aristide. Nous cherchons Octave, nous a-t-on dit qu'il est chez toi.\\

-- Bonjour, F√©lix et petits humains, r√©pondit une voix masculine. Octave n'est pas en forme, mais je peux vous aider.\\

Apr√®s une explication, Aristide offrit de soulever F√©lix pour lui permettre de rep√©rer leur groupe. Un instant plus tard, F√©lix annon√ßa :\\

-- Ils sont par-l√† ! Et pas tr√®s loin, heureusement.\\

Les enfants remerci√®rent le ch√™ne et reprirent leur chemin.\\

-- Pourquoi n'as-tu pas grimp√© sur le ch√™ne ? demanda Cl√©ment.\\

-- Parce que cela aurait √©t√© offensant pour Aristide ! cria F√©lix. Non, mais grimper le vieux ch√™ne... quel scandale...\\

-- Je vous prie de l'excuser, il n'est pas instruit sur votre culture, dit Zo√©.\\

-- Peu importe, peu importe... r√©pondit F√©lix.\\

Apr√®s une bonne demi-heure, F√©lix d√©clara qu'ils √©taient arriv√©s.\\

-- Marchez tout droit, tournez √† droite au grand sapin et vous verrez votre troupeau. Mais promettez de garder le silence sur tout ce que vous avez vu.\\

Zo√© et Cl√©ment firent la promesse, remerci√®rent F√©lix, et repartirent. Une fois arriv√©s au camp, Mademoiselle Ludivine les accueillit avec soulagement.\\

-- Comment avez-vous retrouv√© votre chemin ? demanda-t-elle.\\

-- Euh, on a juste march√© et on s'est retrouv√©s ici par chance, dit Zo√© en clignant de l'≈ìil √† son fr√®re.\\

Give me a reading comprehension exercise for a student learning French. It should have a subsection for answers.,"Apr√®s avoir fini de ranger sa chambre, Alexandre, satisfait de son accomplissement et r√©joui par le beau temps, d√©cida qu'il m√©ritait une r√©compense.\\
Il passa quelques minutes √† penser √† quelque chose qui lui ferait plaisir et que Maman ne lui refuserait pas. Il d√©cida de profiter du beau temps et de passer le reste de la journ√©e dehors.\\

Il alla alors chercher Maman et la trouva dans le salon, en train de passer l'aspirateur.\\
Il se tint droit et attendit qu'elle d√©branche l'engin pour passer √† un autre coin de la pi√®ce, puis, il l'appela.\\

-- Maman ?\\

-- Oui, mon ch√©ri ? r√©pondit-elle avec un sourire.\\

C'√©tait un bon signe ; il y avait peu de chances de refus si elle √©tait de bonne humeur.\\

-- J'ai fini de ranger ma chambre, et je me disais qu'il serait bien si on allait faire un pique-nique maintenant‚Ä¶ dit Alexandre avec un regard suppliant.\\

Maman lui sourit tristement avant de lui dire qu'elle √©tait trop occup√©e pour le moment et qu'il lui restait encore plein de corv√©es.\\

-- S'il te pla√Æt ! Il fait si beau dehors !\\

-- Mais je ne peux pas laisser tout ce travail fait √† moiti√©, mon chou. Tu sais que je peux seulement nettoyer la maison pendant le week-end √† cause de mon travail, expliqua-t-elle.\\

-- D'accord, je peux t'attendre. Quand est-ce que tu vas finir de faire le m√©nage ?\\

Maman soupira avant de c√©der.\\

-- Peut-√™tre dans une heure‚Ä¶ ou moins, si je fais plus vite. Tu peux aller chercher la couverture de pique-nique et l'installer dans le jardin pendant que je termine. Tu la trouveras dans le placard.\\

Alexandre remercia sa Maman et courut faire ce qu'elle lui avait demand√©.\\
Il lutta un peu contre la couverture, qui √©tait coinc√©e sous les draps, avant de la tirer du placard et alla au jardin pour choisir l'endroit parfait o√π la mettre.\\
D'abord, il pensa √† la mettre pr√®s des fleurs, mais changea d'avis en voyant les abeilles butiner.\\
Ensuite, il essaya de poser la couverture au centre du jardin, sur l'herbe fra√Æchement tondue, mais le soleil tapait trop fort.\\
Finalement, il installa la couverture sous l'ombre d'un arbre, l'endroit parfait.\\

Une fois sa t√¢che accomplie, Alexandre regarda la couverture et pensa que la couleur verte des carr√©s qui la composaient ressemblait √† celle de l'herbe.\\
Alors qu'il remarquait ce d√©tail, il aper√ßut du coin de l'≈ìil quelques fourmis grimper sur la couverture.\\
Il les chassa, puis s'allongea sur la couverture pour admirer le ciel en attendant que sa m√®re le rejoigne.\\
Berc√© par les nuages et la douce chaleur du printemps, Alexandre s'endormit. Une petite sieste lui ferait du bien avant le repas de midi.\\

Alexandre ne sut pas combien de temps s'√©tait √©coul√© avant qu'il ne se r√©veille, d√©sorient√©. Cependant, en regardant autour de lui, il se trouva dans une chambre qu'il ne reconnaissait pas.\\
C'√©tait une grande pi√®ce avec du papier peint ressemblant √† celui de chez sa grand-m√®re, un barreau en bois et une chemin√©e.\\
Il jeta les draps qu'il ne reconnaissait pas par-dessus lui et tenta de quitter le lit, mais √©choua et fit une chute.\\

Mais qu'est-ce qu'il faisait dans ce lit de g√©ant ?!\\

Il se leva du sol et se dirigea vers le grand balcon. Ce qu'il vit le surprit au point de lui couper le souffle.\\
La vue √©tait sublime : une grande plaine form√©e de carr√©s alternant de couleur, tant√¥t un vert d'herbe, tant√¥t un blanc de marguerite.\\
Un peu plus loin, il vit un village avec plein de petites maisons et de chalets.\\

Lorsqu'il avan√ßa davantage sur le balcon, il aper√ßut un jardin avec un labyrinthe d'un c√¥t√©, des rosiers de l'autre et une fontaine au centre.\\
Curieux, il se pencha sur les rails du balcon et leva la t√™te pour voir l'endroit offrant une si belle vue. Il s'agissait d'un ch√¢teau.\\

Alexandre n'y comprenait rien. Il d√©cida de retourner √† l'int√©rieur et de s'habiller pour d√©couvrir o√π il se trouvait.\\
Il avait √† peine fait un pas lorsqu'un homme entra dans la chambre avec un ‚ÄúBonjour, messire !‚Äù\\

Alexandre le regarda avec h√©sitation. Il voulait lui demander qui il √©tait, mais les mots le trahirent, et il le scruta en silence.\\

-- Je vois que quelqu'un s'est lev√© du mauvais pied aujourd'hui‚Ä¶ murmura l'homme, qui se tourna ensuite vers l'armoire pour fouiller dedans.\\

-- Que faites-vous ? dit Alexandre, retrouvant enfin sa voix.\\

-- Hmm ? Le monsieur se tourna vers lui, pencha la t√™te et fron√ßa les sourcils. Ce que je fais chaque matin, √©videmment. Je vous pr√©pare votre tenue !\\

-- M-ma tenue ? √áa fait presque deux ans que je m'habille tout seul ! Merci, mais je peux me d√©brouiller, r√©pondit Alexandre, offens√©.\\

Non, mais ! Il le prenait pour qui ?\\

L'homme, semblant tout aussi perplexe, lui r√©pondit d'un ton s√©v√®re :\\

-- Je suis votre valet, Monsieur. C'est mon travail.\\

Give me a reading comprehension exercise for a student learning French. It should have a subsection for answers.,"Un matin chaud en √©t√© vit deux enfants assis devant la t√©l√©vision, regardant l'√©cran, √©pat√©s par une artiste martiale qui d√©montrait quelques mouvements sophistiqu√©s. \\
\textit{-Woah... !} Beth exclama et dut se rappeler de ne pas cligner des yeux pour ne rien rater. \\
\textit{-C'est tellement cool !} son cousin dit. Il regardait l'√©mission avec elle d√®s le d√©but et parut aussi impressionn√© qu'elle l'√©tait, avec les yeux grands ouverts et de petits souffles √† chaque fois qu'un mouvement √©tait d√©montr√©. \\
\textit{-Oui !} agr√©e Beth avec enthousiasme avant que les deux ne se turent de nouveau pour se concentrer sur l'√©mission. \\
Les deux rest√®rent ainsi jusqu'√† la fin de l'√©mission et ne se lev√®rent que lorsqu'ils furent appel√©s pour descendre prendre leur d√©jeuner. \\
\textit{-Je veux devenir une artiste martiale quand je serai grande !} la petite fille dit en sautant les marches de l'escalier. \\
\textit{-Pas moi !} dit son cousin en courant derri√®re elle avec maladresse. \\
Ses mots la firent froncer les yeux en confusion. N'√©tait-il pas aussi impressionn√© qu'elle, tout √† l'heure ? Comment pouvait-il dire √ßa ? \\
\textit{-Pourquoi pas ?} demanda-t-elle sur un ton qui refl√©tait autant de surprise qu'elle avait ressentie. \\
\textit{-J'ai entendu dire que les artistes martiaux doivent s'entra√Æner tr√®s dur. J'ai aussi entendu dire qu'ils doivent casser leurs os et se d√©chirer les muscles pour devenir aussi forts qu'ils le sont,} r√©pondit-il. \\
\textit{-Tu n'es pas s√©rieux !} exclama-t-elle. C'√©tait horrible ! Qui peut bien subir une telle torture ? Beth fr√©mit en pensant au fait de subir cette douleur pour devenir un bon artiste martial et elle pensa qu'elle devrait peut-√™tre y repenser. \\

Mais elle continua √† penser √† l'√©mission qu'elle avait regard√©e tout √† l'heure et √† quel point la dame √©tait cool quand elle donnait des coups de poing et des coups de pied aux planches en bois. \\
Elle voulait vraiment √™tre comme elle. Peut-√™tre qu'elle pourrait prendre des m√©dicaments qui l'aideraient √† supporter la douleur quand elle commencerait √† s'entra√Æner ? \\
Elle regarda son cousin et plissa les yeux. Peut-√™tre que Bobby avait tort √† propos de ce qu'il lui avait dit tout √† l'heure... Et puis, d'o√π il savait, lui ? \\
Elle devait poser la question √† quelqu'un de confiance et elle savait exactement √† qui s'adresser ! \\

Plus tard dans la journ√©e, quand son cousin fit sa sieste, elle descendit parler √† son grand fr√®re qui √©tait charg√© de rester avec eux pendant que leurs parents √©taient absents pour la journ√©e. \\
\textit{-Coucou, Keith !} elle le salua avec bonne humeur. Son grand fr√®re √©tait la personne la plus intelligente qu'elle connaissait. Plus intelligent que ses parents, m√™me ! \\
Il r√©pondait toujours √† ses questions et m√™me quand il ne connaissait pas la r√©ponse, il la cherchait pour elle. \\
\textit{-Coucou, s≈ìurette !} r√©pondit-il avec un sourire en fermant le livre qu'il √©tait en train de lire. \\
\textit{-Que puis-je faire pour toi ?} dit-il en lui pin√ßant le nez avec un sourire taquin. \\
Beth rigola et s'assit √† c√¥t√© de lui sur le canap√©. \\
\textit{-J'ai une question pour toi.} Elle commen√ßa. Quand son fr√®re hocha la t√™te, elle continua. \\
\textit{-Est-ce qu'il est vrai que les artistes martiaux doivent se briser les os et se d√©chirer les muscles quand ils s'entra√Ænent pour devenir plus forts ?} \\

Les yeux de son grand fr√®re devinrent plus larges et il prit un moment avant de lui r√©pondre. \\
\textit{-Je suis s√ªr que ce n'est pas le cas. Qui te l'a dit ?} \\
\textit{-Bobby.} \\
\textit{-Eh bien, comme je te l'ai dit, je ne crois pas que c'est vrai, mais regardons sur internet juste pour √™tre certains.} \\

Beth regarda Keith sortir son t√©l√©phone de sa poche et taper dessus avant de lire ce qui √©tait √©crit sur l'√©cran pendant quelques instants. \\
\textit{-Bon, c'est un peu correct, en quelque sorte.} Beth laissa √©chapper un souffle d'horreur, le poussant √† lever une main pour la calmer. \\
\textit{-Mais, ce n'est pas aussi douloureux que ce qu'on croit.} \\

Beth parut un peu soulag√©e par ces mots. \\
\textit{-Eh bien, c'est comment alors ?} demanda-t-elle avec curiosit√©. \\
Si ce n'√©tait pas de la torture comme elle le croyait, alors elle avait encore une chance pour devenir une artiste martiale dans le futur. \\
Elle √©tait une fille costaud et elle pourrait supporter un peu de douleur ! L'autre jour, elle √©tait tomb√©e et s'√©tait bless√©e au genou, mais elle n'avait m√™me pas pleur√© ! \\

Keith sourit et lui √©bouriffa les cheveux. Il tint son t√©l√©phone en face d'elle et pointa l'√©cran du doigt. \\
\textit{-D'apr√®s cet article, quand les gens s'entra√Ænent pour un sport qui n√©cessite de frapper quelque chose ou quelqu'un, ils doivent donner des coups avec leurs mains, pieds, genoux et tout.} Il expliqua. \\
\textit{Et des fois, ils cassent des planches en bois et des trucs du genre. Pour faire √ßa, ils doivent frapper √† grande vitesse ou bien ils doivent √™tre tr√®s forts. Id√©alement, l'artiste martial utilise une combinaison de force et de vitesse.} \\

\textit{Pour devenir aussi forts, ils doivent s'entra√Æner en soulevant des poids et en faisant des exercices comme des pompes et en frappant des sacs de boxe, et c'est ce qui cause les fissures dans leurs os et leurs muscles.} \\
\textit{Mais ces fissures ne sont pas dangereuses.} l'assura-t-il avec un sourire. \\
\textit{Ce sont juste de toutes petites fissures dans leurs os et quand elles gu√©rissent, l'os devient plus dur et plus fort dans ces endroits.} conclut-il. \\

\textit{-Ohh... ! C'est logique,} Beth dit en hochant lentement la t√™te. \\
\textit{-C'est la m√™me chose pour les muscles, et √ßa n'arrive pas qu'aux artistes martiaux. Des gens comme ceux qui font du bodybuilding soul√®vent des poids lourds et √ßa cause des petites fissures dans leurs muscles √† cause de la charge. Quand le muscle gu√©rit et se reconstruit, il devient plus grand et plus fort. C'est pour √ßa que certains artistes martiaux peuvent briser des briques avec leurs mains, parce qu'ils sont assez forts mais aussi parce qu'ils sont assez rapides quand ils les frappent.} \\

\textit{-Alors, √ßa ne fait pas mal du tout ?} la petite fille demanda. Elle voulait s'assurer avant de prendre sa d√©cision. \\
\textit{-Eh bien, je suis s√ªr que ce genre d'entra√Ænement peut leur donner des courbatures et leur faire un peu mal, mais ce n'est rien de dangereux et s'ils le font correctement, ils ne risquent pas de se blesser,} r√©pondit-il. \\
\textit{Le myst√®re est r√©solu ! Es-tu satisfaite, jeune demoiselle ?} \\

Beth sourit et hocha la t√™te. \\
\textit{-Oui ! Maintenant que tout est clair, je veux devenir une artiste martiale !} annon√ßa-t-elle avec fiert√©. \\
\textit{-Oh ? Sais-tu quel art martial tu veux pratiquer ? Le Karat√© ? Le Judo ? Le Hapkido ?} demanda-t-il. \\
\textit{-Euh... je ne sais pas... encore.} \\
Keith rigola et lui dit qu'elle pouvait demander √† leurs parents quand ils rentreraient. \\
\textit{-Peut-√™tre qu'ils t'emm√®neront √† quelques √©coles d'arts martiaux et tu pourras choisir apr√®s avoir observ√© les autres !}

Give me a reading comprehension exercise for a student learning French. It should have a subsection for answers.,"Margot mangeait son petit d√©jeuner avec app√©tit. Contente de recevoir une visite de son grand-p√®re, elle s'√©tait r√©veill√©e de bonne humeur ce matin.\\
Grand-p√®re √©tait le membre de la famille qu'elle pr√©f√©rait, son meilleur ami parmi les adultes, et elle adorait passer du temps avec lui.\\
Hier soir, lorsqu'il lui avait annonc√© sa visite imminente au t√©l√©phone, il lui avait promis un cadeau et elle √©tait surexcit√©e.\\
D'ailleurs, elle avait eu des difficult√©s √† se coucher tellement elle √©tait √©moustill√©e.\\

Grand-p√®re arriva √† 10h du matin. Il embrassa Maman et Papa avant de prendre Margot dans ses bras.\\

-- Et comment va ma petite fille pr√©f√©r√©e ? demanda-t-il, ses yeux chaleureux regardant Margot avec tendresse.\\

Margot rigola et r√©pondit avec humour :\\

-- Je suis ta seule petite fille, grand-p√®re ! Et je vais tr√®s bien, merci !\\

Puis elle ajouta :\\

-- Et comment va mon grand-p√®re pr√©f√©r√© ?\\

Grand-p√®re, surpris par l'espi√®glerie de Margot, laissa √©chapper un rire avant de lui assurer que, lui aussi, allait tr√®s bien.\\

-- Mais je sais qu'il y a quelque chose que tu veux avoir plus que mes nouvelles, hein ? dit grand-p√®re avec un air taquin.\\

Margot ne sut comment r√©pondre, elle se tortilla un peu avant de le regarder avec ses grands yeux innocents, mais grand-p√®re n'√©tait pas dupe.\\
Il la posa par terre et ils se dirig√®rent tous deux vers le canap√©.\\

Assis l'un √† c√¥t√© de l'autre, Margot regardait grand-p√®re plonger sa main dans un sac en papier avant d'en sortir un petit pot en argile contenant une plante √©pineuse.\\
Margot pencha la t√™te par curiosit√© et scruta la plante que son grand-p√®re avait pos√©e sur la petite table en face d'eux.\\

-- C'est ta surprise, ma ch√©rie. J'esp√®re qu'elle te pla√Æt, lui dit-il.\\

-- C'est quoi ? r√©pondit-elle, tout en se mettant √† genoux devant la table pour observer la plante de plus pr√®s.\\

-- Eh bien, c'est une plante. Un cactus, pour √™tre plus pr√©cis, r√©pondit grand-p√®re avec amusement.\\

Margot hocha la t√™te avec grand int√©r√™t. Un moment plus tard, elle √©tendit sa main pour toucher la plante ronde mais son √©lan fut interrompu par grand-p√®re, qui lui attrapa la main avant qu'elle ne puisse la toucher.\\

-- Attention √† ne pas te faire piquer, dit-il, en indiquant les petites √©pines qui recouvraient la surface du cactus.\\

-- Qu'est-ce que je suis cens√©e faire avec ? demanda Margot, toujours sans quitter des yeux la plante qui la fascinait.\\

-- T'en occuper et la faire pousser. Est-ce que √ßa te tente ?\\

-- Oui, je veux bien essayer !\\

Une fois grand-p√®re rentr√© chez lui, Margot emmena la plante dans sa chambre.\\
Elle l'installa devant sa fen√™tre et l'admira dans son nouvel entourage.\\
Se rappelant que son grand-p√®re lui avait dit qu'elle devait s'en occuper et, sachant que Papa arrosait toujours les plantes du balcon, Margot d√©cida de faire la m√™me chose.\\
Elle alla chercher un verre d'eau et le versa dans le pot, autour de la plante.\\

-- Je vais te donner √† boire tous les jours ! dit-elle au petit cactus.\\

Satisfaite, elle alla faire sa toilette avant d'aller au lit.\\

Pendant les jours qui suivirent, Margot arrosait son cactus r√©guli√®rement. Elle s'assurait qu'il e√ªt assez de soleil et a√©ra sa chambre tous les matins.\\
Elle demandait aussi √† son p√®re d'enlever les petits insectes et parasites qui se posaient sur sa petite plante ador√©e qu'elle cultivait avec amour.\\

Cependant, malgr√© ses efforts, son petit cactus commen√ßa √† perdre son √©clat.\\
Sa belle couleur verte devint p√¢le et Margot sut qu'il se portait mal.\\
Elle se rappela de ce qui √©tait arriv√© aux plantes que son p√®re avait n√©glig√©es lorsqu'ils √©taient partis en vacances l'an dernier.\\

Refusant de laisser son cactus mourir, Margot redoubla d'efforts.\\
Elle commen√ßa √† l'arroser deux fois par jour et l'emmena au balcon pour lui garantir plus de soleil et d'air frais.\\
Mais, malheureusement, cela ne changea rien et l'√©tat de sa plante s'empira.\\

D√©sesp√©r√©e, Margot passa un coup de fil √† Grand-p√®re pour lui dire ce qui se passait.\\

-- Mon cactus est en train de mourir, pourtant j'en ai pris bien soin ! cria-t-elle, les larmes aux yeux.\\

Son grand-p√®re lui demanda de lui expliquer comment elle s'en occupait, esp√©rant identifier ce qui avait bien pu contrarier la petite plante.\\
Margot prit le temps de lui raconter sa routine et, une fois qu'elle eut fini, grand-p√®re lui dit :\\

-- Je suis d√©sol√©, ma puce. Je t'ai donn√© le cactus mais j'ai n√©glig√© de t'expliquer comment t'en occuper.\\
Vois-tu, un cactus est diff√©rent des autres plantes. Il ne demande pas beaucoup d'eau.\\
En fait, tu as seulement besoin de l'arroser une fois par semaine. En l'arrosant chaque jour, c'est comme si tu le noyais et les racines deviennent pourries en cons√©quence.\\

-- Et donc, qu'est-ce que je dois faire maintenant ? demanda-t-elle.\\

-- Ne fais rien. Je viens te voir demain. On va enlever la partie pourrie, s'il y en a, et on va rempoter ton cactus dans du terreau sec.\\
Allez, s√®che tes larmes, ma petite, tout va bien se passer.\\

Margot, rassur√©e par les mots de son grand-p√®re, cessa de pleurer. Elle le remercia avant de raccrocher et r√©p√©ta les mots de son grand-p√®re √† la petite plante :\\

-- Tout ira bien, on va te sauver.\\

Le lendemain, grand-p√®re tint sa parole et arriva chez Margot le matin.\\
Il avait apport√© un pot neuf et un sac de terreau sp√©cial cactus. Margot le regarda avec attention.\\
Elle le vit retirer la plante de son pot actuel, enlever le terreau boueux des racines avant d'en couper une grande partie.\\
Ensuite, il mit des cailloux dans le fond du nouveau pot avant d'y verser du terreau.\\
Il posa le cactus au centre avant de se tapoter les mains pour se d√©barrasser du terreau qui y √©tait rest√©.\\

-- Voil√†, cela devrait faire l'affaire, dit grand-p√®re.\\

Avant de partir, il donna quelques astuces √† Margot.\\
Il lui dit de ne pas arroser la plante pendant trois semaines et lui sugg√©ra de la faire tourner un peu chaque jour pour faire en sorte que toutes ses parties re√ßoivent leur part de soleil.\\

Un mois plus tard, Margot, assise en face de sa fen√™tre, chuchota √† la petite plante qui avait retrouv√© son √©clat :\\

-- Tu vois, je t'ai bien dit qu'on allait te sauver !

Give me a combination of a word problem exercise and an explanation exercise for a 6th grade student learning mathematics. It should have a subsection for answers.,"Ingrid says, ""I can multiply by 100 by adding two zeros."" Explain why Ingrid is wrong.

\subsection*{Answers}
Ingrid's statement is incorrect because simply adding two zeros to a number does not accurately represent multiplication by 100. For example, if you take the number 5.6 and add two zeros, you get 5.600, which is not the same as multiplying 5.6 by 100, which equals 560. This method only works for whole numbers and does not apply to decimal numbers or fractions."
