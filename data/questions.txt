(English) (Writing Exercise, Creative Writing Exercise) D 5 (With Illustration, Exercise on story continuation)

The three hobbits, Merry, Pippin, and Frodo, found themselves deep in the heart of a dark and twisted forest. The trees loomed high above them, their branches tangled like fingers clawing at the sky. Shadows flickered all around, and even the faintest sounds seemed louder, echoing eerily among the trunks.

Merry, always the cheerful one, tried to keep everyone’s spirits up. Though he was feeling uncertain, he whistled softly to himself as they walked, hoping his calmness might rub off on the others. Occasionally, he caught a glimpse of what he thought was a path, and he felt a little surge of relief every time they seemed to be going in the right direction.

But Pippin was struggling. The darkness, the strange sounds, and the constant feeling of being lost gnawed at him. At one point, he couldn’t hold back his frustration anymore. “I can’t bear it!” he shouted, breaking the silence and startling the others. It felt as though the trees were closing in on him, and he began to doubt whether they’d ever find their way out.

Frodo, leading the way, tried to stay hopeful, though doubts were creeping into his mind. Every turn looked the same, and after a while, he began to wonder if they were going in circles. “What if there’s no way through?” he murmured to himself, his voice barely audible. But he kept moving forward, hoping against hope that they would eventually find an escape.

Then, just as despair began to settle in, Merry caught sight of something up ahead—a path, winding its way through the trees and leading toward what looked like the edge of the forest. He let out a low whistle of relief, and Frodo and Pippin quickly followed his gaze. Could this be their way out?

You are going to write the next part of the story. What do you think the characters do, say and feel when they find their way out of the forest?

\begin{enumerate}
\item Merry
In the forest Merry seemed fairly cheerful and whistled with relief when he saw the path.
Do you think Merry was more or less worried than the others?
When they find their way out, what do you think Merry:
\begin{enumerate}
\item does?
\item thinks?
\item feels?
\end{enumerate}

\item Pippin
In the forest Pippin 'could not bear it any longer' and 'let out a shout'.
Do you think Pippin was more or less worried than the others?
When they find their way out, what do you think Pippin:
\begin{enumerate}
\item does?
\item thinks?
\item feels?
\end{enumerate}

\item Frodo
In the forest Frodo began to wonder if it were possible to find a way through.
Do you think he was more or less worried than the others?
When they find their way out, what do you think Frodo:
\begin{enumerate}
\item does?
\item thinks?
\item feels?
\end{enumerate}

\item Use your notes to write the next part of the story in your exercise book.

(French) (Reading Comprehension Exercise Exercise) D G (With Answer, Multi-part)

C'était un beau jour d'été, le soleil transperçait les rideaux de la chambre et on pouvait sentir la douce chaleur du petit matin.\\
Il était difficile de continuer à ignorer le chant des oiseaux et des criquets, l'aboiement du chien et le brouhaha des habitants de la maison.\\
Martin soupira avec regret, et éjecta sa couverture d'un coup de pied.\\
Il bailla et se frotta les yeux avant de quitter son lit.\\
Il jeta un coup d'œil à son réveil et grogna de mécontentement quand il remarqua qu'il s'était réveillé beaucoup plus tôt qu'il n'avait prévu.\\
\\
-- Et moi qui voulais faire la grasse matinée... marmonna-t-il.\\
\\
Il alla faire sa toilette et, avant de se brosser les dents, laissa échapper un sourire moqueur en voyant son reflet.\\
Ses cheveux étaient tout ébouriffés! Il avait même un peu de bave qui dégoulinait du bout de sa bouche.\\
Une fois propre, il se dirigea vers la cuisine pour prendre son petit déjeuner.\\
Il y avait une délicieuse odeur dans toute la maison et, même s'il ne savait pas de quoi il s'agissait, il en voulait une grosse part.\\
\\
En entrant, il entendit sa mère et son grand frère chuchoter puis les vit.\\
\\
-- J'ai économisé assez d'argent pendant les trois dernières années. N'oublie pas que je travaillais aussi pendant l'été, disait Lucas.\\
\\
Il avait la tête inclinée envers Maman et lui jetait un regard suppliant. Maman lui lança un regard douteux avant de retourner son attention vers la poêle.\\
Elle retourna une crêpe avant de poser sa spatule puis questionna Lucas:\\
\\
-- Mais est-ce que tu crois que ça va te suffire pour acheter une voiture? C'est plutôt cher comme engin tu sais...\\
\\
-- Oui! Une petite voiture d'occasion, je n'ai pas besoin d'une voiture neuve dès le début, répondit le grand frère.\\
\\
Lorsque sa mère ne dit rien, Lucas ajouta:\\
\\
-- S'il te plaît Maman, je viens d'avoir mon bac. Je ne vais quand même pas vous demander de me conduire à l'Université tous les jours lors de la rentrée! Et puis, ce n'est pas comme si vous deviez conduire Martin au collège non plus puisqu'il est en vacances. Papa a plus de temps libre maintenant.\\
\\
Maman laissa échapper un soupir puis sourit indulgemment:\\
\\
-- D'accord, je vais en parler à ton père, acquiesça-t-elle, mais la décision lui revient.\\
\\
Lucas hocha la tête avec un sourire et embrassa Maman sur la joue en la remerciant.\\
\\
-- C'est tout ce que je te demande, dit-il.\\
\\
Martin, se doutant de ce qui se passait, décida de confirmer ses soupçons.\\
\\
-- Qu'est-ce qu'il y a? demanda-t-il d'un ton nonchalant, en sortant une boîte de jus du réfrigérateur.\\
\\
-- Bonjour chéri, ton frère veut apprendre à conduire, répondit-elle.\\
\\
Papa avait accepté de donner des cours de conduite à Lucas. Tous les jours, ils sortaient l'après-midi, passaient environ deux heures dehors puis rentraient de mauvaise humeur. Papa et Lucas étaient clairement contrariés après les fameux cours de conduite et Martin se demanda ce qui pouvait bien se passer pour qu'ils soient aussi fâchés, ce qui le poussa à demander de les accompagner pour la prochaine leçon.\\
\\
-- Je m'ennuie, ça me tente de venir avec vous, dit-il en guise d'excuse pendant qu'ils dînaient. Même si ce n'est que pour un jour, ajouta-t-il.\\
\\
Lucas acquiesça d'un haussement d'épaules, et Martin vit Maman fixer lourdement Papa, le poussant à accepter sa demande.\\
\\
C'était décidé, Martin allait partir avec eux!\\
\\
Le lendemain, Martin s'installa sur la banquette arrière, et mit sa ceinture de sécurité.\\
Il observa silencieusement Papa s'asseoir à l'avant et Lucas au volant. Ce dernier ajusta son siège ainsi que les rétroviseurs avant de mettre le contact.\\
Environ une heure et demie après, le trio rentra à la maison.\\
Papa et Lucas étaient fâchés comme les derniers jours et Martin avait l'air pensif. Il avait compris la cause de leur conflit: Papa n'est pas un bon enseignant.\\
Il n'était pas du tout patient, et Lucas n'appréciait pas ses directives et commentaires dits sur un ton irrité.\\
\\
Ayant pitié de son grand frère, Martin décida de lui suggérer une solution d'une manière subtile.\\
\\
Il alla s'asseoir à côté de lui sur le canapé et laissa s'écouler quelques minutes avant de commencer à parler.\\
\\
-- Ce n'est pas vraiment simple de conduire avec Papa, hein? dit-il avec un sourire compatissant.\\
\\
-- Ouais, c'est le moins qu'on puisse dire..., répondit Lucas en levant les yeux au ciel.\\
\\
-- J'avais la même impression lorsqu'il m'apprenait les tables de multiplication au primaire, heureusement que j'avais réglé le problème rapidement.\\
\\
Lucas, intrigué par les paroles de son petit frère, se tortilla un peu avant de glisser un peu plus près de Martin.\\
Il s'éclaircit la gorge et demanda d'une voix basse:\\
\\
-- Et comment t'as fait?\\
\\
Martin le regarda d'un air complice et lui dit:\\
\\
-- J'ai demandé à Maman de le faire à sa place. Elle est beaucoup plus patiente et douce.\\
\\
Lucas lui lança un regard douteux puis fronça les sourcils.\\
\\
-- Je pense que Maman est trop occupée pour m'apprendre à conduire.\\
\\
-- Alors aides-la avec ses corvées, rétorqua Martin.\\
\\
Lucas hocha la tête mais ne dit rien.\\
Il y eut un long moment de silence avant que le frère aîné ne pinçât la joue de Martin, le remerciant pour son conseil.\\
\\
-- Lorsque j'aurai mon permis, je t'emmènerai au parc d'attraction chaque semaine! lui dit-il, excité.\\
\\
Martin s'en doutait mais il sourit quand même, ravi d'avoir pu aider son grand-frère.\\
\\
Quelques jours après, la paix et l'harmonie étaient de retour à la maison.\\
Lucas avait commencé à faire le linge et à laver la vaisselle, accordant plus de temps libre à Maman et par conséquent, plus de temps pour lui apprendre à conduire.\\
\\
Après le changement d'enseignants, Lucas fit beaucoup plus de progrès et s'inscrivit peu après pour passer son permis.\\
Au bout de quelques mois, la famille exprimait sa fierté tandis que Lucas les conduisait à un restaurant pour célébrer sa réussite.\\
\\
-- C'est grâce aux cours de conduite que je lui ai donnés, dit Papa avec un sourire orgueilleux.\\
\\
Les trois autres ne dirent rien mais levèrent les yeux au ciel. Enfin, tous sauf Lucas qui devait garder les yeux sur la route!

\begin{enumerate}
\item Pourquoi Martin sourit lorsqu'il vit son reflet?
      \begin{enumerate}
          \item[A.] À cause de son apparence

(French) (Reading Comprehension Exercise) D G (With Answer)

Un matin, alors qu'il était assis devant la fenêtre, le visage crispé, Lucien lâcha un soupir en voyant le temps qu'il faisait.\\
Cela allait faire bientôt une semaine qu'il pleuvait à torrents et ça l'agaçait énormément.\\
Il tourna vers ses camarades de garderie et les regarda avec curiosité. Comment pouvaient-ils continuer à jouer avec une telle indifférence ?\\
C'est comme s'ils s'étaient résignés à l'ennui, un truc qu'il ne pouvait accomplir.\\
Il jeta un dernier regard hors de la fenêtre, à l'aire de jeux qui se tenait sous la pluie, et haussa les épaules.\\
Tant pis, il n'aura qu'à penser à autre chose pour faire passer le temps.\\

Il regarda autour de lui et vit Damien qui jouait avec les petits soldats.\\
Il se dirigea vers lui et lui tapota l'épaule. Une fois qu'il eut son attention, il lui dit qu'il en avait assez de rester à l'intérieur sans rien faire d'amusant.\\

-- On peut jouer à cache-cache avec les autres, si tu veux ? suggéra Damien.\\

Lucien n'était pas vraiment intéressé au vieux jeu. Il voulait vivre une aventure, sentir la joie et l'excitation de l'inconnu.\\

-- Non…\\

Il prit une pause, réfléchit un moment puis dit à Damien :\\

-- J'ai une meilleure idée. Aide-moi à rassembler les autres.\\

Lorsque tout le monde fut réuni, Lucien leur demanda de s'asseoir en cercle puis commença à parler avec un ton sérieux.\\

-- On va jouer au village maudit, leur annonça-t-il.\\
Il s'agit d'un village envahi par les ogres et les sorcières.\\
Les villageois doivent se cacher et éviter de se faire attraper par les ogres pour enfin aller au château et alerter les soldats et sauver le village,\\
expliqua Lucien en montrant les soldats que Damien avait alignés.\\
-- Ils doivent souvent changer de cachette car les ogres peuvent les renifler s'ils restent dans le même endroit trop longtemps.\\
Et quoi qu'il arrive, ils ne doivent jamais laisser une sorcière leur mettre la main dessus.\\

Il désigna à chacun son rôle.\\

-- Pierre, Éloïse et Manon sont les ogres.\\

-- Hé ! Mais je ne veux pas être une ogresse ! protesta Manon.\\

-- C'est comme ça. Tu seras la princesse dans la prochaine partie, lui dit Lucien.\\

La fillette, étant la plus jeune du groupe et donc la plus naïve, ne s'était pas rendu compte qu'il n'y avait pas de princesse dans le jeu, et se contenta de jouer le rôle de l'ogresse pour le moment,\\
permettant à Lucien de continuer.\\

-- Damien, moi et Sabine sommes les villageois.\\

Sabine, confuse par l'affectation des rôles, lui demanda qui joueront les rôles des sorcières puisque tout le monde avait déjà un rôle.\\
Lucien se pencha vers le groupe d'enfants et dit d'une voix basse et menaçante :\\

-- Les sorcières… c'est les aides maternelles !\\

Le groupe laissa échapper quelques exclamations et cris de surprise avant de se lever et partir assumer leurs positions.\\

Les ogres dormirent pendant que les villageois allèrent se cacher.\\
Lucien se plongea dans le monde qu'il venait de créer.\\

Désormais, sa crèche ressemblait aux bois médiévaux qu'on trouve dans les contes de fées et lui-même se voyait vêtu d'un pantalon moulant marron, d'une cotte-hardie verte et chaussé d'une paire de bottes usées.\\
Il courut, essoufflé, et se cacha derrière un arbre.\\
Il jeta un coup d'œil furtif pour voir si les ogres s'étaient réveillés et vit qu'en effet, ils l'étaient.\\
Il les guetta et les vit en train de marcher dans différentes directions, s'arrêtant pour chercher derrière des arbres ou à l'intérieur des grottes.\\

À un moment, lorsqu'il vit que les ogres lui tournaient le dos, il fila à toute vitesse pour changer d'abri.\\
Son cœur battait la chamade et il était trempé de sueur lorsqu'il s'accroupit derrière un buisson.\\
Il écarta son feuillage et vit Damien qui essayait de se faufiler derrière les grandes bêtes, mais par malchance,\\
celui-ci ne vit pas la pièce de Lego--plutôt la branche qui était sur son chemin et marcha dessus, alertant les ogres de sa présence.\\

Lucien, souhaitant sauver son ami, prit une des baies du buisson et la jeta sur l'ogre le plus proche de Damien, détournant son attention et permettant à l'autre villageois de s'enfuir à temps.\\
Lucien profita de la confusion pour changer, lui aussi, de cachette.\\
Il grimpa sur un arbre et regarda du haut de son perchoir pour voir comment les autres s'en sortaient.\\

Damien se tenait debout derrière un arbre, inaperçu par les ogres, et Sabine tentait de changer de cachette mais sans succès.\\
Lorsqu'elle se jeta enfin dans la gueule du loup, la plus jeune ogresse lui mit la main dessus.\\

Navré par le sort de sa voisine, Lucien secoua la tête avant de se rappeler qu'il devait changer de cachette avant qu'il ne se fasse repérer.\\
En se dirigeant vers un autre arbre, il vit du coin de l'œil que Damien aussi s'était fait capturer.\\

Malgré sa tristesse, il savait qu'il devait continuer, ne serait-ce que pour sauver le village. Trois contre un, ses chances de survie étaient minces, mais il refusait de renoncer à sa quête.\\

Il respira profondément avant de foncer vers les soldats.\\
Il était si proche ! Il allait y arriver ! Ses jambes ne le tenaient plus, ses poumons brûlaient et le vent soufflait contre lui mais rien ne l'arrêta.\\

À deux pas des soldats, il heurta un grand mur qui apparut de nulle part.\\
L'impact le lança à terre et il entendit Sabine s'exclamer :\\

-- Non ! La sorcière l'a eu !\\

Expulsé de son monde fantastique, Lucien fit un petit sourire penaud à son institutrice avant de s'excuser.\\

-- Ce n'est pas grave, dit-elle avec un sourire.\\
-- Je suis venue vous chercher pour le déjeuner.\\
Il y a une soupe de citrouille dans le chaudron qui n'attend que vous !\\

Hier soir, lorsqu'il lui avait annoncé sa visite imminente au téléphone, il lui avait promis un cadeau et elle était surexcitée.\\
D'ailleurs, elle avait eu des difficultés à se coucher tellement elle était émoustillée.\\

Grand-père arriva à 10h du matin. Il embrassa Maman et Papa avant de prendre Margot dans ses bras.\\

-- Et comment va ma petite fille préférée ? demanda-t-il, ses yeux chaleureux regardant Margot avec tendresse.\\

Margot rigola et répondit avec humour :\\

-- Je suis ta seule petite fille, grand-père ! Et je vais très bien, merci !\\

Puis elle ajouta :\\

-- Et comment va mon grand-père préféré ?\\

Grand-père, surpris par l'espièglerie de Margot, laissa échapper un rire avant de lui assurer que, lui aussi, allait très bien.\\

-- Mais je sais qu'il y a quelque chose que tu veux avoir plus que mes nouvelles, hein ? dit grand-père avec un air taquin.\\

Margot ne sut comment répondre, elle se tortilla un peu avant de le regarder avec ses grands yeux innocents, mais grand-père n'était pas dupe.\\
Il la posa par terre et ils se dirigèrent tous deux vers le canapé.\\

Assis l'un à côté de l'autre, Margot regardait grand-père plonger sa main dans un sac en papier avant d'en sortir un petit pot en argile contenant une plante épineuse.\\
Margot pencha la tête par curiosité et scruta la plante que son grand-père avait posée sur la petite table en face d'eux.\\

-- C'est ta surprise, ma chérie. J'espère qu'elle te plaît, lui dit-il.\\

-- C'est quoi ? répondit-elle, tout en se mettant à genoux devant la table pour observer la plante de plus près.\\

-- Eh bien, c'est une plante. Un cactus, pour être plus précis, répondit grand-père avec amusement.\\

Margot hocha la tête avec grand intérêt. Un moment plus tard, elle étendit sa main pour toucher la plante ronde mais son élan fut interrompu par grand-père, qui lui attrapa la main avant qu'elle ne puisse la toucher.\\

-- Attention à ne pas te faire piquer, dit-il, en indiquant les petites épines qui recouvraient la surface du cactus.\\

-- Qu'est-ce que je suis censée faire avec ? demanda Margot, toujours sans quitter des yeux la plante qui la fascinait.\\

-- T'en occuper et la faire pousser. Est-ce que ça te tente ?\\

-- Oui, je veux bien essayer !\\

Une fois grand-père rentré chez lui, Margot emmena la plante dans sa chambre.\\
Elle l'installa devant sa fenêtre et l'admira dans son nouvel entourage.\\
Se rappelant que son grand-père lui avait dit qu'elle devait s'en occuper et, sachant que Papa arrosait toujours les plantes du balcon, Margot décida de faire la même chose.\\
Elle alla chercher un verre d'eau et le versa dans le pot, autour de la plante.\\

-- Je vais te donner à boire tous les jours ! dit-elle au petit cactus.\\

Satisfaite, elle alla faire sa toilette avant d'aller au lit.\\

Pendant les jours qui suivirent, Margot arrosait son cactus régulièrement. Elle s'assurait qu'il eût assez de soleil et aéra sa chambre tous les matins.\\
Elle demandait aussi à son père d'enlever les petits insectes et parasites qui se posaient sur sa petite plante adorée qu'elle cultivait avec amour.\\

Cependant, malgré ses efforts, son petit cactus commença à perdre son éclat.\\
Sa belle couleur verte devint pâle et Margot sut qu'il se portait mal.\\
Elle se rappela de ce qui était arrivé aux plantes que son père avait négligées lorsqu'ils étaient partis en vacances l'an dernier.\\

Refusant de laisser son cactus mourir, Margot redoubla d'efforts.\\
Elle commença à l'arroser deux fois par jour et l'emmena au balcon pour lui garantir plus de soleil et d'air frais.\\
Mais, malheureusement, cela ne changea rien et l'état de sa plante s'empira.\\

Désespérée, Margot passa un coup de fil à Grand-père pour lui dire ce qui se passait.\\

-- Mon cactus est en train de mourir, pourtant j'en ai pris bien soin ! cria-t-elle, les larmes aux yeux.\\

Son grand-père lui demanda de lui expliquer comment elle s'en occupait, espérant identifier ce qui avait bien pu contrarier la petite plante.\\
Margot prit le temps de lui raconter sa routine et, une fois qu'elle eut fini, grand-père lui dit :\\

-- Je suis désolé, ma puce. Je t'ai donné le cactus mais j'ai négligé de t'expliquer comment t'en occuper.\\
Vois-tu, un cactus est différent des autres plantes. Il ne demande pas beaucoup d'eau.\\
En fait, tu as seulement besoin de l'arroser une fois par semaine. En l'arrosant chaque jour, c'est comme si tu le noyais et les racines deviennent pourries en conséquence.\\

-- Et donc, qu'est-ce que je dois faire maintenant ? demanda-t-elle.\\

-- Ne fais rien. Je viens te voir demain. On va enlever la partie pourrie, s'il y en a, et on va rempoter ton cactus dans du terreau sec.\\
Allez, sèche tes larmes, ma petite, tout va bien se passer.\\

Margot, rassurée par les mots de son grand-père, cessa de pleurer. Elle le remercia avant de raccrocher et répéta les mots de son grand-père à la petite plante :\\

-- Tout ira bien, on va te sauver.\\

Le lendemain, grand-père tint sa parole et arriva chez Margot le matin.\\
Il avait apporté un pot neuf et un sac de terreau spécial cactus. Margot le regarda avec attention.\\
Elle le vit retirer la plante de son pot actuel, enlever le terreau boueux des racines avant d'en couper une grande partie.\\
Ensuite, il mit des cailloux dans le fond du nouveau pot avant d'y verser du terreau.\\
Il posa le cactus au centre avant de se tapoter les mains pour se débarrasser du terreau qui y était resté.\\

-- Voilà, cela devrait faire l'affaire, dit grand-père.\\

Avant de partir, il donna quelques astuces à Margot.\\
Il lui dit de ne pas arroser la plante pendant trois semaines et lui suggéra de la faire tourner un peu chaque jour pour faire en sorte que toutes ses parties reçoivent leur part de soleil.\\

Un mois plus tard, Margot, assise en face de sa fenêtre, chuchota à la petite plante qui avait retrouvé son éclat :\\

-- Tu vois, je t'ai bien dit qu'on allait te sauver !

(French) (Reading Comprehension Exercise) D G (With Answer)

C'était un beau jour, ensoleillé, frais et calme. Le chien des Dupont était dans un coin de la cuisine, étendu sur son ventre, la tête posée sur le sol entre ses pattes.\\
Il était en train d'ignorer Solène, sa jeune maîtresse qui avait encore eu une crise de colère à cause du contenu de sa gamelle, et essayait de dormir un peu après avoir lui-même vidé la sienne.\\

-- Non, je n'en veux pas ! cria la jeune fille en poussant son assiette loin d'elle.\\

Solène Dupont était une petite fille âgée de sept ans. Ses parents et sa grande sœur l'adoraient et faisaient tout pour la rendre heureuse. Elle aussi aimait beaucoup sa famille ainsi que son chien, mais les trouvait parfois frustrants, comme lorsqu'ils l'obligeaient à manger quelque chose qui ne lui plaisait pas, comme ce jour-là.\\

-- Mais pourquoi donc ? demanda sa Maman d'un ton exaspéré.\\

Mme Dupont pensa qu'il n'était pas aussi difficile d'élever sa fille aînée avant de retourner son attention vers Solène.\\

-- Parce que.\\
Elle croisa les bras avec un regard grincheux.\\

-- C'est dégueulasse les brocolis ! Même grande sœur n'en mange pas ! dit Solène en tournant la tête vers sa sœur aînée.\\

La grande sœur en question leva la tête avec surprise mais ne dit rien. Elle était bien trop sage pour s'impliquer dans les moments de rage de sa petite sœur.\\
Elle regarda sa mère avec commisération, lui souhaitant silencieusement bonne chance.\\

-- C'est parce qu'elle est allergique aux brocolis, tu le sais très bien, rétorqua Maman.\\

-- Et moi je ne trouve pas ça bon du tout ! Je ne vais pas en manger ! Et tu ne peux pas m'obliger, dit Solène d'un ton définitif.\\

Mme Dupont soupira. Ce n'était pas la première fois que sa benjamine refusait de manger un plat par caprice, sans même y goûter. Mais elle finissait toujours par changer d'avis. Il suffisait juste de trouver une ruse pour la convaincre.\\

-- Papa adore les brocolis, il en mange tout le temps…\\
Elle essaya, sachant que sa fille aimait imiter son père.\\

Solène haussa les épaules, pas du tout impressionnée.\\

-- Et alors ? Les adultes mangent plein de trucs dégoûtants ! Il aime aussi les cornichons, les anchois et les oignons, beurk !\\

Amusée par les mots de sa fille, Maman sourit avant de reprendre un air sérieux.\\

-- D'accord, ça ne te plaît pas, je comprends…\\
Elle prit une pause pour réfléchir avant de proposer :\\

-- Et si on faisait un marché, toi et moi ?\\

Solène, intéressée, se détendit un peu et lança un regard attentif à Maman.\\

-- Pendant cette semaine, je vais cuisiner des plats au brocoli. Je te demande seulement d'en prendre une bouchée, et si ça ne te plaît toujours pas, je ne vais plus jamais te demander d'en manger, dit Maman en tendant la main pour conclure le marché.\\

Solène la regarda, incertaine, mais après avoir réfléchi, elle accepta et lui serra la main avec un sourire arrogant.\\

Le lendemain, Solène se mit à table à midi et Maman lui servit son déjeuner : un bol de soupe et une assiette contenant un gratin.\\
L'odeur était alléchante et Solène eut l'eau à la bouche.\\

-- Soupe aux poireaux et gratin aux brocolis et au fromage pour aujourd'hui, dit Maman avec un sourire avant de l'embrasser sur la tempe.\\
-- Bon appétit !\\

La petite fille fronça les sourcils en entendant le mot « brocolis » et se demanda comment quelque chose de si détesté pouvait sentir aussi bon.\\

-- Rappelle-toi que tu m'as promis d'y goûter ! Allez, ça ne va pas te tuer ! dit Maman avant de s'asseoir à table.\\

-- Oui, Maman, dit Solène avec désenchantement.\\

Elle joua un peu avec sa nourriture pour retarder l'inévitable avant de se résigner à en prendre une bouchée.\\
À sa surprise, ce qu'elle mangeait n'était pas si mal. C'était même un peu bon.\\

-- Alors, qu'en penses-tu ? demanda Maman après quelques minutes de silence.\\

-- Ce n'est pas complètement mauvais… dit Solène en reprenant une autre bouchée.\\

Mme Dupont, contente que son plan fonctionne, sourit et commença à manger elle aussi.\\

Tout au long de la semaine, elle prépara des plats à base de brocoli : quiche aux brocolis et poulet, poêlée de légumes, brocolis sautés à la crème, etc.\\
Solène finissait toujours son assiette, même si elle regardait cette dernière avec scepticisme avant de manger.\\

Lorsque la semaine prit fin, Maman demanda à sa fille si elle voulait toujours abandonner les brocolis à jamais.\\

Solène fit mine de réfléchir mais finit par dire qu'elle ne les détestait pas autant, après tout.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Pourquoi Solène avait piqué une crise de colère ?
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item[A.] Parce qu'elle voulait plus de jus
        \item[B.] Parce qu'elle voulait manger au salon
        \item[C.] Parce qu'elle ne voulait pas manger de brocolis
        \item[D.] Parce qu'elle n'avait pas de fourchette
    \end{enumerate}

    \item D'après Solène, les adultes mangent... ?
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item[A.] Plein de trucs dégoûtants
        \item[B.] Que des trucs bons
        \item[C.] N'importe quoi
        \item[D.] Tout ce qu'ils veulent
    \end{enumerate}

    \item Que suggéra Maman à Solène ?
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item[A.] Elle lui suggéra de conclure un marché
        \item[B.] Elle lui suggéra de monter dans sa chambre
        \item[C.] Elle lui suggéra de ne rien manger
        \item[D.] Elle lui suggéra de se faire un sandwich
    \end{enumerate}

    \item Lequel parmi ces plats maman avait cuisiné ?
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item[A.] Une quiche aux épinards
        \item[B.] Une quiche aux brocolis et au poulet
        \item[C.] Une quiche aux légumes
        \item[D.] Une quiche au thon
    \end{enumerate}

    \item Solène avait fini par...

        \item[B.] Dire qu'elle voulait manger des brocolis tous les jours

(French) (Reading Comprehension Exercise) D G (With Answer)

Lily leva la tête vers le ciel et ronronna de contentement lorsqu'elle sentit la chaleur des rayons du soleil lui envelopper le corps.\\
Elle se leva lentement de sa position allongée et s'étira. Samedi était le jour favori de la chatonne car sa propriétaire, Sarah, passait presque toute la journée à la maison.\\
Elle en prenait soin, la chouchoutait et lui donnait plein de gâteries. Ce samedi était particulièrement agréable car on pouvait clairement sentir l'arrivée du printemps.\\

-- C'était une bonne sieste, dit-elle distraitement en se dirigeant vers sa fontaine à eau dans le couloir.\\

Elle jeta un coup d'œil à sa gamelle de croquettes et fut ravie de voir qu'elle était pleine.\\
Elle lapa un peu d'eau avant d'aller s'installer sur son panier. Elle commença à se lécher lentement et avec précision, prenant soin de le faire tous les jours pour garder son beau pelage blanc propre et brillant.\\
Mais, au bout d'un moment, elle remarqua qu'elle perdait plus de poils que d'habitude. En effet, elle avait dû s'éclaircir la gorge en se débarrassant d'une boule de poils pour continuer sa toilette -- deux fois de suite !\\

Avec horreur, elle en conclut qu'elle était en train de devenir chauve. Dévastée, elle pensa qu'une fois tous ses poils tombés, Sarah ne l'aimerait plus et qu'elle la jetterait dehors. L'idée lui brisa le cœur, et elle décida de partir avant d'être forcée à faire face à l'inévitable.\\

Elle alla voir Sarah qui faisait sa sieste, la regarda tendrement avant de partir, la queue entre les pattes.\\
Une fois dehors, elle ne sut pas trop où aller ni quoi faire. Elle avait passé toute sa vie chez Sarah et n'avait aucune idée de comment survivre dans la nature... ou plutôt dans les jungles de ciment qui formaient la cité.\\

Pour le moment, elle décida d'errer sans but. En trottant le long de la rue, sa mélancolie s'effaça pour faire place à sa curiosité. Elle observa les bâtiments, les humains, les magasins et les quelques espaces verts qui décoraient la cité.\\
Une odeur délicieuse l'attira vers la façade d'un restaurant de grillades, et elle sentit son estomac vide protester, regrettant de ne pas avoir mangé quelques croquettes avant de sortir.\\

Fatiguée, affamée et terrifiée par cette grande ville sans fin, elle ne s'arrêta que lorsqu'elle sentit la langue d'un autre chat sur sa joue.\\
Elle tourna la tête brusquement pour voir qui était venu la réconforter et aperçut une vieille chatte de gouttière, probablement errante aussi, car elle ne portait pas de collier.\\

-- Tu as faim, je présume ? dit la vieille féline d'une douce voix.\\

-- O-oui... répondit Lily timidement.\\

-- Viens avec moi. Il y aura de bons morceaux de viande dans l'allée dans peu de temps.\\

Dégoûtée par l'idée de manger le contenu d'une poubelle, Lily fit une grimace qui fit sourire la vieille chatte.\\

-- Ne t'inquiète pas. Les cuisiniers de ce restaurant nous laissent souvent les restes sur des assiettes en mousse ou des boîtes en carton. La nourriture est propre.\\

Rassurée, Lily la suivit et s'installa avec elle au pied de l'escalier de secours du bâtiment voisin du restaurant.\\
La vieille chatte se présenta comme Agathe, et Lily se présenta en retour.\\
Tandis qu'elles attendaient leur repas, une autre chatte et deux petits chatons les rejoignirent.\\

La maman les salua, tandis que les deux petits continuaient à jouer ensemble.\\

-- On a de la compagnie aujourd'hui ? demanda la nouvelle arrivée à Agathe.\\

-- En effet. Cleo, je te présente Lily, répondit Agathe avant de dire à Lily que les deux chatons s'appelaient Max et Lu.\\

Un moment après, un humain du restaurant leur apporta des morceaux de viande grillée dans une boîte en carton et les caressa un peu avant de retourner à l'intérieur pour les laisser manger en paix.\\
Une fois rassasiées, le groupe de chats se dirigea vers un pont pour passer la nuit en dessous.\\
Telle était leur routine quotidienne : ils traversaient la cité pour aller manger puis retournaient s'abriter sous le pont.\\

Au bout de quelques jours, alors qu'ils étaient en route, Lily s'arrêta devant un lampadaire et regarda une affiche d'un air triste.\\

-- Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ? interrogea Agathe, qui n'avait pas encore vu l'affiche, et Lily la lui indiqua d'un mouvement de tête.\\

-- Oh ! C'est toi ! dit Agathe, et Lily hocha la tête.\\

-- C'est ma propriétaire, Sarah, qui a dû mettre ces affiches… Elle me manque tellement.\\

-- Pourquoi l'as-tu quittée alors ?\\

-- Parce que je ne voulais pas qu'elle me mette dehors, cria Lily.\\

-- Pourquoi te mettrait-elle dehors ? Si elle ne voulait pas de toi, elle ne se serait sans doute pas donné la peine de coller ces affiches.\\

-- Une fois que j'aurai perdu tous mes poils, elle n'aurait plus voulu de moi, dit Lily en baissant la tête.\\

-- Comment ça ? Tes poils m'ont l'air en parfait état.\\

-- Non ! Je suis en train de les perdre ! La semaine dernière, j'ai constaté que j'en perdais plus que d'habitude.\\

Agathe lui donna un petit coup de tête.\\

-- Tu n'es pas très futée, dis donc ?\\

Lily la regarda, offensée, et Agathe lui expliqua qu'il était tout à fait normal pour les chats de perdre plus de poils pendant le printemps et que, contrairement à ce qu'elle pensait, elle n'était pas en train de perdre tout son pelage.\\

-- Mais bon, tu es jeune, donc je suppose que c'est la première fois pour toi, dit la vieille chatte en haussant les épaules.\\
-- Rentre chez toi, je suis sûre que tu manques beaucoup à ta Sarah.\\

Rassurée de ne pas être en train de perdre son plus beau trait, Lily ne perdit plus de temps.\\
Elle remercia Agathe et Cleo et courut retrouver sa propriétaire et sa maison.\\

Sarah l'accueillit avec les larmes aux yeux et la couvrit de câlins et de friandises.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Pourquoi Lily se léchait-elle le pelage ?
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item[A.] Pour le mouiller
        \item[B.] Parce qu'il la grattait
        \item[C.] Pour le garder blanc et propre

(French) (Reading Comprehension Exercise) D G (With Answer)

Après avoir fini de ranger sa chambre, Alexandre, satisfait de son accomplissement et réjoui par le beau temps, décida qu'il méritait une récompense.\\
Il passa quelques minutes à penser à quelque chose qui lui ferait plaisir et que Maman ne lui refuserait pas. Il décida de profiter du beau temps et de passer le reste de la journée dehors.\\

Il alla alors chercher Maman et la trouva dans le salon, en train de passer l'aspirateur.\\
Il se tint droit et attendit qu'elle débranche l'engin pour passer à un autre coin de la pièce, puis, il l'appela.\\

-- Maman ?\\

-- Oui, mon chéri ? répondit-elle avec un sourire.\\

C'était un bon signe ; il y avait peu de chances de refus si elle était de bonne humeur.\\

-- J'ai fini de ranger ma chambre, et je me disais qu'il serait bien si on allait faire un pique-nique maintenant… dit Alexandre avec un regard suppliant.\\

Maman lui sourit tristement avant de lui dire qu'elle était trop occupée pour le moment et qu'il lui restait encore plein de corvées.\\

-- S'il te plaît ! Il fait si beau dehors !\\

-- Mais je ne peux pas laisser tout ce travail fait à moitié, mon chou. Tu sais que je peux seulement nettoyer la maison pendant le week-end à cause de mon travail, expliqua-t-elle.\\

-- D'accord, je peux t'attendre. Quand est-ce que tu vas finir de faire le ménage ?\\

Maman soupira avant de céder.\\

-- Peut-être dans une heure… ou moins, si je fais plus vite. Tu peux aller chercher la couverture de pique-nique et l'installer dans le jardin pendant que je termine. Tu la trouveras dans le placard.\\

Alexandre remercia sa Maman et courut faire ce qu'elle lui avait demandé.\\
Il lutta un peu contre la couverture, qui était coincée sous les draps, avant de la tirer du placard et alla au jardin pour choisir l'endroit parfait où la mettre.\\
D'abord, il pensa à la mettre près des fleurs, mais changea d'avis en voyant les abeilles butiner.\\
Ensuite, il essaya de poser la couverture au centre du jardin, sur l'herbe fraîchement tondue, mais le soleil tapait trop fort.\\
Finalement, il installa la couverture sous l'ombre d'un arbre, l'endroit parfait.\\

Une fois sa tâche accomplie, Alexandre regarda la couverture et pensa que la couleur verte des carrés qui la composaient ressemblait à celle de l'herbe.\\
Alors qu'il remarquait ce détail, il aperçut du coin de l'œil quelques fourmis grimper sur la couverture.\\
Il les chassa, puis s'allongea sur la couverture pour admirer le ciel en attendant que sa mère le rejoigne.\\
Bercé par les nuages et la douce chaleur du printemps, Alexandre s'endormit. Une petite sieste lui ferait du bien avant le repas de midi.\\

Alexandre ne sut pas combien de temps s'était écoulé avant qu'il ne se réveille, désorienté. Cependant, en regardant autour de lui, il se trouva dans une chambre qu'il ne reconnaissait pas.\\
C'était une grande pièce avec du papier peint ressemblant à celui de chez sa grand-mère, un barreau en bois et une cheminée.\\
Il jeta les draps qu'il ne reconnaissait pas par-dessus lui et tenta de quitter le lit, mais échoua et fit une chute.\\

Mais qu'est-ce qu'il faisait dans ce lit de géant ?!\\

Il se leva du sol et se dirigea vers le grand balcon. Ce qu'il vit le surprit au point de lui couper le souffle.\\
La vue était sublime : une grande plaine formée de carrés alternant de couleur, tantôt un vert d'herbe, tantôt un blanc de marguerite.\\
Un peu plus loin, il vit un village avec plein de petites maisons et de chalets.\\

Lorsqu'il avança davantage sur le balcon, il aperçut un jardin avec un labyrinthe d'un côté, des rosiers de l'autre et une fontaine au centre.\\
Curieux, il se pencha sur les rails du balcon et leva la tête pour voir l'endroit offrant une si belle vue. Il s'agissait d'un château.\\

Alexandre n'y comprenait rien. Il décida de retourner à l'intérieur et de s'habiller pour découvrir où il se trouvait.\\
Il avait à peine fait un pas lorsqu'un homme entra dans la chambre avec un “Bonjour, messire !”\\

Alexandre le regarda avec hésitation. Il voulait lui demander qui il était, mais les mots le trahirent, et il le scruta en silence.\\

-- Je vois que quelqu'un s'est levé du mauvais pied aujourd'hui… murmura l'homme, qui se tourna ensuite vers l'armoire pour fouiller dedans.\\

-- Que faites-vous ? dit Alexandre, retrouvant enfin sa voix.\\

-- Hmm ? Le monsieur se tourna vers lui, pencha la tête et fronça les sourcils. Ce que je fais chaque matin, évidemment. Je vous prépare votre tenue !\\

-- M-ma tenue ? Ça fait presque deux ans que je m'habille tout seul ! Merci, mais je peux me débrouiller, répondit Alexandre, offensé.\\

Non, mais ! Il le prenait pour qui ?\\

L'homme, semblant tout aussi perplexe, lui répondit d'un ton sévère :\\

-- Je suis votre valet, Monsieur. C'est mon travail.\\

\emph{Hein ?!!!}\\

(\textit{À suivre...})

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Pourquoi Alexandre voulait-il faire un pique-nique ?
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item[A.] Car il s'ennuyait

        \item[C.] Car ça lui avait manqué

(French) (Reading Comprehension Exercise) D G (With Answer)

-- V-Valet ? s'écria Alexandre, stupéfait par ce qu'il venait d'entendre.\\

-- C'est exact… Êtes-vous sûr que vous vous sentez bien, messire ? demanda le monsieur en déposant les vêtements sur le lit.\\

-- Je… n'en sais rien, répondit Alexandre en passant la main dans ses cheveux. Excusez-moi, mais quel est votre nom ?\\

-- Samuel, dit le valet avec un regard curieux. Je crois que vous feriez mieux de vous recoucher, messire. Vous n'êtes clairement pas dans votre assiette.\\

Alexandre refusa mais lui dit qu'il préférerait s'habiller lui-même et lui demanda de sortir de la pièce. Une fois présentable, Alexandre sortit de sa chambre. Samuel l'attendait au bout du corridor et s'inclina devant lui avant de lui dire qu'il allait le conduire à la salle à manger pour le petit déjeuner. Samuel ajouta qu'ils partiraient ensuite au village pour récupérer sa nouvelle épée chez le forgeron, et Alexandre acquiesça avec incertitude.\\

Au salon, il rencontra trois hommes qui se levèrent à son entrée puis le saluèrent. Samuel lui murmura qu'ils étaient ses chevaliers. Surpris par l'information, Alexandre se demanda qui il était dans cet univers pour vivre dans un château, avoir un valet, une épée et des chevaliers. Sa question trouva réponse lorsqu'une des dames de cour entra et s'adressa à lui.\\

-- Messire, son altesse votre mère vous informe qu'elle arrivera de son voyage à temps pour le déjeuner.\\

Son altesse sa mère… il était donc un prince. Il tourna vers Samuel pour confirmer son hypothèse, et d'une voix basse, celui-ci lui dit :\\

-- Pas seulement un prince, messire. Vous êtes le gardien du royaume du damier.\\

Gardien du royaume du damier… Alexandre comprit que le nom du royaume venait de ses plaines, mais que voulait Samuel dire par “gardien” ? De quoi était-il censé garder le royaume ? Samuel interrompit ses pensées et lui dit qu'il était temps de partir pour le village. Ensemble, les deux se dirigèrent vers les écuries.\\

Au début, l'idée de monter sur un cheval rendit Alexandre anxieux. Il n'avait jamais fait quelque chose de pareil et passa quelques moments à penser à une bonne excuse pour éviter l'engagement. Mais, une fois face au bel étalon noir et après l'avoir caressé un peu, il changea d'avis. Il monta sur son cheval et Samuel fit de même avec sa jument. Ils échangèrent quelques mots de temps en temps pendant qu'ils trottaient vers leur destination, et une fois arrivés, Samuel lui dit qu'il allait vérifier si l'épée était prête.\\

Pendant les moments qu'il passa seul, Alexandre observa autour de lui. Il vit des villageois qui marchaient un peu partout, des vendeurs de fruits et légumes et divers magasins. Soudain, il entendit des cris de détresse. Son cheval sursauta et faillit le faire tomber. Il se retourna pour voir d'où venaient les hurlements, et ses yeux s'élargirent de surprise : des fourmis géantes piétinaient le village.\\

Samuel, attiré par le tumulte, sortit de l'atelier.\\

-- Messire ! cria-t-il, poussant Alexandre à faire tourner son cheval vers lui. Tenez ! dit-il en lui lançant une épée.\\

-- Mais qu'est-ce que je suis censé en faire ? dit Alexandre en l'attrapant maladroitement.\\

-- Utilisez-la pour chasser les fourmis ! Vous l'avez déjà fait, voyons !\\

-- Je vous assure que non ! Je n'ai aucune idée de comment m'y prendre !\\

-- J'ai foi en vous, messire ! Bonne chance ! dit Samuel avant de se sauver avec le reste des villageois.\\

Alexandre n'eut même pas le temps de réfléchir avant qu'une fourmi lui saute dessus. Par réflexe, il la bloqua et s'éloigna d'elle au galop. Surpris par sa capacité à brandir une épée, il la manipula et la fit tourner dans sa main un peu.\\

-- Tant pis, s'ils veulent que je sois le gardien, je vais être le gardien ! se dit-il avant de retourner au champ de bataille.\\

Bien qu'il l'ait fait avec hésitation au début, Alexandre se battit férocement et courageusement. Il lança des coups d'épée et fonça vers ses ennemis. Ses chevaliers ne tardèrent pas à le rejoindre et ensemble, ils chassèrent les fourmis hors du royaume.\\
Les villageois sortirent de leurs abris et les acclamèrent chaleureusement.\\

-- Vive le prince ! Vive les chevaliers ! Vive le royaume du damier ! criaient-ils avec joie.\\

De retour au château, les chevaliers et Samuel s'excusèrent de la grande salle pour laisser Alexandre parler avec la reine.\\

-- Maman ! s'écria le gardien lorsqu'il vit enfin un visage familier.\\

Il fit quelques pas pour embrasser sa mère, mais son élan fut interrompu par une soudaine sensation de vertige. La dernière chose qu'il entendit avant de perdre conscience fut la voix de sa mère.\\

-- Alexandre, Alexandre, Alex!...\\

Lorsqu'il ouvrit les yeux de nouveau, il se trouva face à face avec sa Maman. Elle lui caressait les cheveux et lui souriait.\\

-- Allez, debout petit paresseux. Tu ne veux plus faire de pique-nique ? lui demanda-t-elle. Papa va nous rejoindre d'un moment à l'autre. Il m'a appelé tout à l'heure et m'a dit qu'il avait fini de faire les courses.\\

Alexandre prit le temps de regarder autour de lui avant de se jeter dans les bras de sa mère. Il était de retour dans son monde. Ou plutôt, il s'était réveillé de son rêve.\\

-- Maman ! Tu ne vas pas croire tes oreilles lorsque je te raconte où j'étais ni ce que j'ai fait ! dit-il avec enthousiasme.\\

-- J'ai sauvé le royaume du damier des vilaines fourmis, Maman !!!\\

La mère d'Alexandre rigola et lui dit qu'il pourrait tout lui raconter pendant qu'ils déjeuneront.

(French) (Reading Comprehension Exercise) D G (With Answer)

Un beau jour ensoleillé, les élèves de la garderie \textit{Le Lièvre} partirent en randonnée dans le bois avec leur institutrice. Celle-ci avait choisi un itinéraire assez facile pour les tout-petits et marchait à un rythme lent pour ne pas les fatiguer.\\

-- Zoé ? Clément, un des petits garçons qui marchaient en queue, appela sa sœur.\\

-- Oui ? répondit son aînée.\\

Zoé trouvait l'activité à son goût. Depuis toute petite, elle aimait marcher, courir et sauter. C'était une fillette très active, contrairement à son petit frère gâté qui préférait se faire porter.\\

-- J'ai faim. Quand est-ce qu'on va manger ? demanda-t-il.\\

-- On mangera quand on arrivera aux chalets. Mademoiselle Ludivine nous l'a déjà dit.\\

-- Mais j...\\

Avant qu'il ne puisse finir sa phrase, Clément trébucha sur une pierre et tomba. Il se redressa mais resta agenouillé, gémissant de douleur en s'essuyant le visage. Zoé, exaspérée par son petit frère étourdi, soupira et s'arrêta pour l'aider.\\

-- Tu es tombé parce que tes lacets sont défaits. Regarde ! dit-elle en indiquant ses chaussures d'un mouvement de tête.\\

-- Ah ! Une minute, je vais les refaire !\\

Distrait, Clément cessa de pleurer et se concentra sur ses lacets, mais après plusieurs tentatives infructueuses, sa grande sœur perdit patience. Elle s'accroupit pour les refaire elle-même.\\

-- Laisse-moi faire, sinon on y passera la journée, dit-elle.\\

Une fois ses chaussures sécurisées, Clément et sa sœur reprirent leur route pour rejoindre les autres. Mais après une bonne dizaine de minutes, ils réalisèrent qu'ils s'étaient séparés du groupe.\\

-- Ah ! Ils ont avancé drôlement vite, dis donc ! remarqua Zoé.\\

Les deux continuèrent à marcher jusqu'à une bifurcation.\\

-- Tu crois qu'ils sont partis par où ? demanda Clément.\\

-- Je n'en sais rien. Mais on doit choisir.\\

-- Je vais le faire ! répondit son frère.\\

\textit{Am stram gram, pique et pique et colégram, bourre et bourre et ratatam, am stram gram !}\\

Il chanta en pointant le doigt sur les deux chemins, puis déclara qu'ils iraient à gauche. Zoé accepta, et ils se remirent en route. En chemin, Clément se plaignit de la chaleur, de la fatigue et de la faim. Zoé, l'ignorant, lui tendit sa gourde.\\

-- Bois un peu d'eau, dit-elle.\\

Ils marchèrent en silence avant que Clément demande à nouveau quand ils arriveraient.\\

-- Je n'en sais pas plus que toi, Clément ! répondit-elle. D'ailleurs, je crois que nous sommes perdus...\\

Clément, tentant de garder son calme, se rassura en pensant que sa grande sœur, courageuse et intelligente, trouverait une solution.\\

-- Qu'est-ce qu'on va faire maintenant ? demanda-t-il.\\

-- Peut-être qu'on doit rester ici et attendre qu'on nous envoie de l'aide. Mademoiselle Ludivine finira par se rendre compte de notre absence tôt ou tard... dit Zoé avec incertitude.\\

Désirant aider, Clément lui suggéra quelques solutions.\\

-- Peut-être qu'on devrait grimper sur l'arbre le plus haut pour repérer le camp.\\

-- Ce serait trop dangereux, soupira Zoé.\\

-- Alors, on peut continuer à marcher jusqu'au sommet de la montagne.\\

-- On ne sait même pas quel chemin prendre pour atteindre le sommet...\\

-- On peut --\\

-- Non, Clément ! On ne peut rien faire ! Arrête de m'agacer ! On va rester ici et attendre que quelqu'un vienne pour nous ! cria Zoé, à bout de patience.\\

Vexé par le ton de sa sœur, Clément commença à pleurer. Zoé, regrettant son éclat de colère, le prit dans ses bras pour s'excuser.\\

-- Allez, viens, on va manger. Je sais que tu as faim, lui dit-elle en le menant vers une souche.\\

Les deux sortirent leurs boîtes à lunch et commencèrent à manger. Au bout d'un moment, Clément aperçut un écureuil qui les guettait depuis un arbre.\\

-- Je crois qu'il a faim, dit Zoé.\\

-- Maman nous a mis de la tarte aux noix de pécan, tu veux lui en offrir un peu ?\\

Clément, enthousiaste, prit un morceau de tarte et s'approcha doucement de l'animal, qui commença à manger dans sa main. Quand tous furent rassasiés, une voix les surprit :\\

-- Vous êtes perdus, n'est-ce pas ?\\

Zoé et Clément regardèrent autour d'eux jusqu'à ce que la voix leur dise de regarder en bas. Bouche bée, ils réalisèrent qu'elle venait de l'écureuil.\\

-- I-i-il parle ! cria Clément.\\

-- C'est exact, dit l'écureuil avec un petit sourire espiègle.\\

-- Z-Z-Zoé ! Il parle ! balbutia Clément, tournant vers sa sœur pétrifiée.\\

L'écureuil lâcha un soupir, plus ennuyé qu'amusé maintenant.\\

-- Mais évidemment que je parle. Tout le monde parle dans le bois enchanté !\\

Cela fit enfin sortir Zoé de son état de transe.\\

-- Le bois enchanté ? répéta-t-elle.\\

-- Comme je viens de le dire, rétorqua l'animal. Mais j'y pense, je ne me suis pas encore présenté. Je m'appelle Félix. Félix DuBois, ajouta-t-il.\\

Clément éclata de rire au jeu de mots, tandis que Zoé se présenta, elle et son frère.\\

-- Pour vous remercier d'avoir partagé votre repas avec moi, que diriez-vous si je vous conduisais à votre troupeau ?\\

-- On a un troupeau ? chuchota Clément.\\

-- Il parle de nos camarades et de Mademoiselle Ludivine, l'informa Zoé.\\

-- Alors, qu'en dites-vous ?\\

-- Oui ! Oui... on vous en serait très reconnaissants, Monsieur DuBois ! dit Zoé avec un sourire.\\

-- Appelez-moi Félix. Monsieur DuBois est mon père, dit-il avant de leur demander de le suivre.\\

Ils marchèrent un moment en silence, puis Clément commença à interroger leur guide.\\

-- Et vous êtes sûr que vous n'avez pas de pouvoirs magiques ? demanda-t-il.\\

-- Sûr et certain, mon petit, répondit l'écureuil patiemment.\\

-- Et les autres habitants du bois ? Est-ce qu'ils en ont ?\\

-- Hmm... eh bien, oui. Certains, comme les vieux chênes, les loups, ou l'aigle.\\

Clément écoutait avec des yeux brillants d'émerveillement. Félix continua :\\

-- Le vieux chêne a le pouvoir de guérison. Les animaux blessés viennent souvent à lui pour demander de l'aide. Il est aussi le plus vieux de la forêt, après tout.\\

Ils marchèrent encore un peu avant d'atteindre la cascade sacrée, l'endroit où les animaux se désaltèrent. Ils y virent toutes sortes d'animaux. Clément, impressionné, serra la main de sa sœur.\\

-- C'est bizarre, je ne le vois pas. Il devrait être ici, dit Félix. Octave, notre aigle, vient toujours à cette heure...\\

Une louve au pelage blanc salua Félix.\\

-- Bonjour, Félix. Toujours aussi radieuse, Hélène, répondit Félix. Aurais-tu vu Octave ?\\

-- Il est malade. Tu le trouveras sûrement près du vieux chêne, dit-elle.\\

Félix guida les enfants vers le chêne.\\

-- Bonjour, Aristide. Nous cherchons Octave, nous a-t-on dit qu'il est chez toi.\\

-- Bonjour, Félix et petits humains, répondit une voix masculine. Octave n'est pas en forme, mais je peux vous aider.\\

Après une explication, Aristide offrit de soulever Félix pour lui permettre de repérer leur groupe. Un instant plus tard, Félix annonça :\\

-- Ils sont par-là ! Et pas très loin, heureusement.\\

Les enfants remercièrent le chêne et reprirent leur chemin.\\

-- Pourquoi n'as-tu pas grimpé sur le chêne ? demanda Clément.\\

-- Parce que cela aurait été offensant pour Aristide ! cria Félix. Non, mais grimper le vieux chêne... quel scandale...\\

-- Je vous prie de l'excuser, il n'est pas instruit sur votre culture, dit Zoé.\\

-- Peu importe, peu importe... répondit Félix.\\

Après une bonne demi-heure, Félix déclara qu'ils étaient arrivés.\\

-- Marchez tout droit, tournez à droite au grand sapin et vous verrez votre troupeau. Mais promettez de garder le silence sur tout ce que vous avez vu.\\

Zoé et Clément firent la promesse, remercièrent Félix, et repartirent. Une fois arrivés au camp, Mademoiselle Ludivine les accueillit avec soulagement.\\

-- Comment avez-vous retrouvé votre chemin ? demanda-t-elle.\\

-- Euh, on a juste marché et on s'est retrouvés ici par chance, dit Zoé en clignant de l'œil à son frère.\\

(French) (Reading Comprehension Exercise) D G (With Answer)

-- Tu vas bouder toute la journée ? dit Maxime à son frère.\\

-- Ce n'est pas comme si j'ai quelque chose de mieux à faire, répondit Bruno.\\

Les jeunes jumeaux étaient dans leur chambre. Ils avaient été punis car ils avaient négligé leurs études et obtenu de mauvaises notes aux examens. Leur mère les obligea à réviser toute la matinée, puis les envoya dans leur chambre après le déjeuner. Mais, le pire de tout, elle avait aussi confisqué leurs consoles de jeux vidéo, ordinateurs portables et téléphones. Ils étaient maintenant coincés dans une pièce sans aucun moyen de divertissement.\\

-- On pourrait jouer aux cartes, si tu veux...\\

-- Non, Max, c'est ennuyeux.\\

-- \textit{Un, deux, trois, soleil} alors ?\\

-- Non, la chambre n'est pas assez grande.\\

-- On peut lire un livre… dit Maxime, avec de moins en moins d'enthousiasme à chaque suggestion.\\

Sa dernière proposition sembla captiver l'attention de son frère, qui le regarda avec un air moins déprimé.\\

-- Quel livre ? demanda Bruno.\\

-- Celui avec l'histoire des pirates ?\\

-- Humm… OK, pourquoi pas.\\

Quand les deux copies du livre furent tirées des étagères au-dessus de leurs bureaux, les garçons commencèrent à lire l'histoire à haute voix, chacun interprétant les dialogues des personnages. En ce moment, Maxime jouait La Mouette : un moussaillon étourdi qui causait bien des problèmes à bord, tandis que Bruno était Capitaine Barbedure, qui passait son temps à le réprimander.\\

-- Mille sabords ! Espèce de marin d'eau douce ! Mais que fais-tu encore ! s'écria Bruno, ou plutôt Capitaine Barbedure.\\

-- C-C-Capitaine ! Je nettoyais le plancher, Monsieur !\\

-- Tu veux dire, tu \textit{noyais} le plancher, oui ! Il y a plus d'eau ici que par-dessus bord !\\

-- Je-je-je m'excuse, Capitaine ! Je vais sécher tout ça en un rien de temps !\\

Capitaine Barbedure grogna et tenta d'aller parler au timonier. Mais, en prenant un pas, La Mouette le heurta, et il perdit l'équilibre. Sa jambe en bois se coinça dans le seau que La Mouette utilisait pour nettoyer, et il tomba sur le dos.\\

-- Mille million de mille sabords ! exclama Barbedure.\\

Maxime étouffa un rire en entendant Bruno dire cela, mais lorsque son frère lui jeta un regard fâché, il s'éclaircit la gorge et reprit sa lecture.\\

-- Capitaine ! s'écria La Mouette, inquiet pour Barbedure et pour son propre sort. Tenez ! Prenez ma main, je vais vous aider !\\

-- Hors de ma vue, abruti ! Tu as fait assez de mal comme ça ! Décampe avant que je t'envoie nourrir les poissons !\\

Barbedure lutta pour se relever, puis se dirigea vers sa cabine pour changer ses vêtements, trempés après sa chute.\\

Les deux enfants tournèrent la page pour passer au chapitre suivant, et, lorsque Bruno vit que c'était une partie plus amusante, il dit à son frère qu'ils allaient désormais jouer les rôles des personnages, et pas seulement leur prêter leurs voix.\\

-- Viens, on va préparer la scène, dit Bruno.\\

Ils tirèrent leurs chaises de bureau et les disposèrent côte à côte, devant le lit de Bruno. Celui-ci sortit une règle de 30 centimètres de son cartable tandis que Maxime alla chercher la ceinture de son peignoir. Ils prirent également leurs équerres et se mirent debout sur leurs lits, transformés en navires, tandis que le sol représentait la mer.\\

Bruno jouait Barbedure, comme avant, mais Maxime était désormais Gustave : un capitaine de la marine royale, attaquant le bateau pirate de Barbedure.\\

-- Chargez les canons, moussaillons ! hurla Barbedure, en pointant son équerre -- euh, pistolet -- sur Gustave.\\

Il tira mais manqua sa cible, qui s'était sauvée à temps. Après quelques échanges de tirs entre les deux ennemis, Barbedure ordonna à son équipage de mettre feu aux canons, et ils coulèrent le bateau des adversaires. Cependant, Capitaine Gustave avait réussi à se servir d'une corde pour sauter de son bateau et atterrir sur le bateau pirate. Il tenta de tirer sur Barbedure mais fut capturé avant de pouvoir appuyer sur la gâchette.\\

-- Alors, on veut se la jouer héros, Moussaillon ? dit Barbedure à Gustave, ligoté.\\

-- Je combattrai jusqu'à mon dernier souffle ! répondit le marin.\\

-- Votre dernier souffle arrivera plus tôt que vous ne le pensez ! dit le pirate, provoquant les rires grossiers de son équipage.\\

Barbedure ordonna à ses hommes de jeter l'ancre et de lui ramener son sabre. Il leur dit ensuite de soulever Capitaine Gustave et de le mettre sur la planche de bois dépassant du bord du bateau.\\

-- J'espère bien que vous êtes prêt pour votre premier -- et dernier, j'ose dire -- supplice de la planche ! dit le pirate, debout derrière son prisonnier, en pointant son sabre sur son dos.\\

-- Un dernier mot ?\\

-- Mécréant ! Vous serez capturé tôt ou tard !\\

-- Maintenant, c'est vous qui êtes capturé. Et c'est le moment d'une baignade avec les requins. Allez ! Sautez !\\

-- Mais qu'est-ce qui se passe ici ? dit Maman en ouvrant la porte.\\

Elle entra et trouva Bruno qui utilisait sa règle pour pousser Maxime en arrière. Bruno était debout sur son lit, et Maxime, les mains liées avec la ceinture de son peignoir, se tenait sur les chaises de bureau représentant la planche du bateau.\\

-- Euh… rien, Maman ! dit Bruno avec un air innocent.\\

-- On… euh, on jouait aux pirates, expliqua Maxime, ne trouvant pas de justification crédible.\\

-- Je vois… eh bien, vous pouvez continuer à jouer si vous voulez, mais je suis venue vous chercher pour le goûter.\\

Bruno posa sa règle sur le lit et rendit à Maxime sa liberté.\\

-- Allez ! Viens, marin d'eau douce ! C'est l'heure de la chasse au trésor ! dit Bruno, et ensemble, ils descendirent s'approprier le butin : des cookies et du lait !\\

(French) (Reading Comprehension Exercise) D G (With Answer)

Magali sourit avec satisfaction en regardant les deux pages pleines de son cahier. Finir ses devoirs lui inspirait toujours un sentiment de productivité. Elle commença à ranger ses affaires lorsqu'elle entendit frapper à sa porte. Elle vit qu'il s'agissait de sa mère, qui entra après avoir reçu sa permission.\\

-- Salut, ma chérie. Que fais-tu ? dit Maman avec un tendre sourire.\\

-- Salut ! répondit la fillette en haussant les épaules. Rien du tout. Je viens de finir mes devoirs, et maintenant je n'ai plus rien à faire.\\

-- C'est très bien, ma puce, la louangea Maman. Et ça tombe bien que tu n'aies plus rien à faire, parce que j'ai quelque chose pour toi.\\

Magali s'assit sur sa chaise de bureau, attendant que Maman lui révèle ce qu'elle lui avait apporté. Celle-ci sortit un livre caché derrière son dos et le lui tendit.\\

-- C'est un livre de coloriage et un conte de fées en même temps, dit Maman avant de s'installer à côté de Magali, qui ouvrait le livre.\\

-- Tu vois, là. Elle lui montra une image du doigt. C'est l'illustration de référence. Tu dois colorier le dessin avec les mêmes couleurs que celles qui y sont. Et dans cette partie, dit-elle en lui montrant l'autre page, se trouve l'histoire.\\

Après son explication et après que sa fille l'eut remerciée, Maman quitta la chambre. Magali lut l'histoire et conclut que c'était un conte de fées typique : une princesse n'avait pour compagnie que son chien et s'ennuyait dans son palais. Sa marraine, la bonne fée, lui jeta un sort et transforma ses vêtements pour qu'elle ressemble à une villageoise. Cela lui permit de s'aventurer dans le village, où elle rencontra un prince qui, lui aussi, se déguisait pour explorer les royaumes voisins.\\

Elle trouva que c'était une sorte de Cendrillon à l'envers et ne fut pas vraiment impressionnée ; elle passa donc au coloriage. Mais, après deux dessins, elle jugea les illustrations peu intéressantes et décida de prendre les choses en main. Elle allait changer l'histoire et adapter les dessins à sa propre version du récit. Elle retourna aux pages précédentes et commença à rêvasser.\\

Elle changea la couleur de la robe de la princesse, passant du rose au noir avec des traits verts. Dans sa tête, la princesse était devenue l'ambassadrice d'une autre planète. Elle dessina un trait rouge qui s'étendait de la baguette magique de la marraine à la robe : c'était un rayon laser. La marraine était devenue vilaine et avait volé les vêtements de l'ambassadrice pour l'empêcher de retourner sur sa planète, car ses vêtements lui permettaient de se téléporter.\\

Magali bascula dans son monde imaginaire, où elle devint Célestine, l'ambassadrice interstellaire. Après avoir perdu ses vêtements, Célestine alla retrouver son gardien. Ce dernier avait pris l'apparence d'un chien, mais c'était en réalité un extraterrestre humanoïde, comme elle.\\

-- Éon ! cria-t-elle. On doit partir d'ici immédiatement ! Ce palais n'est plus sûr. J'ai découvert que les humains complotent pour envahir notre planète, et l'une d'eux m'a pris mon uniforme lorsqu'elle m'a repérée.\\

-- Je n'en crois pas mes oreilles, Dame Célestine ! répondit le chien avec horreur. Je vais contacter notre base aérienne pour les prévenir de notre arrivée !\\

Il se dirigea vers le miroir de la coiffeuse dans la chambre de l'ambassadrice et toucha la glace. Après quelques gestes, il se retrouva face à une personne de son espèce et lui expliqua brièvement ce qui s'était passé, avant d'informer qu'ils allaient rentrer plus tôt que prévu.\\

-- Nous devons nous rendre au village immédiatement, c'est là où j'ai planté la capsule d'urgence, dit-il à Célestine.\\

-- Allons-y !\\

Les deux s'échappèrent furtivement du palais et coururent vers le village. Une fois arrivés, ils ralentirent pour ne pas éveiller les soupçons des humains.\\

-- La capsule se trouve au fond du puits, dit Éon. C'est là que nous devons aller.\\

Ils se rendirent au centre du village, et Éon reprit son apparence humaine. Lui et la princesse firent semblant de se rencontrer et d'échanger quelques mots pendant qu'il sortait discrètement la capsule du puits. Ils étaient sauvés ! Ils montèrent à bord et quittèrent la Terre pour informer leur peuple des manigances humaines.\\

Magali sortit de son monde imaginaire et prit soin d'effacer le chien des images où le prince était présent ; dans sa version, c'était la même personne. Elle modifia également la tenue et dessina la capsule spatiale. Elle tourna les pages du livre et admira fièrement son œuvre. Les dessins étaient désormais plus excitants, pleins de couleurs vives, de noir et de gris pour les vêtements des extraterrestres et la capsule.\\

Maman revint avec un plateau contenant son goûter, prête à lui demander si elle avait aimé le livre, mais elle s'arrêta en voyant les coloriages.\\

-- Pourquoi ne t'es-tu pas basée sur les images de référence, ma chérie ? demanda-t-elle.\\

-- Parce que je n'ai pas trop aimé l'histoire, répondit Magali. Alors je l'ai changée.\\

Maman lui demanda de raconter sa version, et Magali le fit en utilisant ses dessins pour mieux expliquer. Maman l'applaudit et pensa qu'elle n'avait peut-être pas apporté le bon cadeau à son enfant. Le lendemain, elle lui offrit un carnet de feuilles blanches et lui dit :\\

-- Comme ça tu pourras écrire et dessiner tes propres histoires !\\

\begin{enumerate}

        \item[B.] Parce qu'elle avait besoin de plus d'espace
        \item[C.] Parce qu'il est mort

(French) (Reading Comprehension Exercise) D G (With Answer)

Un beau jour, dans une cabane perchée dans un arbre, un groupe d'enfants était rassemblé pour passer la journée ensemble. Amis depuis leur plus jeune âge, ils allaient tous à la même école et passaient leur temps libre les uns avec les autres. Ce jour-là, ils étaient chez Hervé. Celui-ci, allongé sur le dos, un bras sous la tête, semblait pensif. Un moment plus tard, il se redressa pour prendre une position assise et dit à ses amis :\\

-- Vous vous rappelez de la fête d'anniversaire d'Aurélie ?\\

-- Je ne pense pas qu'on soit prêts de l'oublier de sitôt, répondit Capucine en posant son livre d'histoire avant de se tourner vers lui.\\

-- C'était la fête la plus amusante de ma vie ! remarqua Aude avec un sourire.\\

-- Oui ! s'écria Marcel. Il y avait tellement de jeux ! On pouvait jouer sur le trampoline et même aller dans la piscine !\\

-- Et il y avait tant de bonnes choses à manger ! ajouta Cyril avec un sourire rêveur.\\

-- Tu parles de la pinata ou des coupes de glace ? lui demanda Aude avec un sourire taquin.\\

-- Je pense qu'on est tous d'accord que la pizza géante était la star du buffet, dit Hervé.\\

-- Mais j'y pense, comment fait-on une pizza aussi grande ?\\

Les autres enfants prirent un moment pour réfléchir à la question de Capucine, mais Aude fut la première à répondre en disant que son père lui avait expliqué que les choses géantes étaient faites avec des pièces assemblées dans une usine.\\

-- Je suppose que c'est logique, vu que la pizza avait quatre parties avec des garnitures différentes, dit Marcel en hochant la tête. Ma partie préférée était celle avec la garniture poulet-champignons, miam ! Vous imaginez si on essayait d'en faire une nous-mêmes ? demanda Cyril avec enthousiasme.\\

À ces mots, les quatre autres commencèrent à rêvasser. Ils furent transportés de leur petite cabane en bois à une grande usine sophistiquée, pleine de machines et de matériaux.\\

-- On va commencer par diviser les tâches, dit Hervé. Capucine et Cyril feront la pâte, Aude et Marcel prépareront la sauce, et moi, je râperai le fromage. Quand on aura fini, on laissera lever les quartiers de pâte, puis on fera cuire les différentes garnitures, assemblera la pizza, mettra la sauce, la garniture et le fromage, et cuira chaque partie dans un four différent. Une fois toutes les parties prêtes, on assemble le tout !\\

Les autres acceptèrent le plan d'Hervé, sauf Cyril, qui leva la main et dit :\\

-- Je voudrais râper le fromage à ta place, et toi, tu peux faire la pâte avec Capucine.\\

-- Pas question ! dit Aude. Tu mangerais la moitié du fromage si on te laissait faire.\\

Hervé, Capucine et Marcel rirent tandis que Cyril boudait en murmurant que ce n'était pas juste. Les cinq mirent des tabliers, des gants et des coiffes de cuisinier, puis se dispersèrent chacun dans leur coin.\\

Capucine demanda à Cyril de lui chercher la farine et la levure pendant qu'elle chauffait un peu d'eau. Elle versa la levure dans l'eau tiède avec un peu de sucre tandis que Cyril lui ramena l'huile et le sel.\\

-- Hé, Capucine, regarde ! dit Cyril avant de lui mettre de la farine sur le nez lorsqu'elle releva la tête pour le regarder.\\

-- Hé !!!\\

Elle lui rendit la pareille, et les deux éclatèrent de rire avant de se remettre au travail. Ils mirent les ingrédients dans le pétrin, puis posèrent le bol près du four préchauffé.\\

Pendant ce temps, Aude et Marcel préparaient la sauce.\\

-- Pourquoi on doit y mettre du sucre ? demanda Marcel.\\

-- Pour neutraliser l'acidité de la tomate, répondit la fillette.\\

-- Est-ce qu'on a vraiment besoin de toutes ces épices ?\\

-- Oui, c'est ce qui donne un bon goût à la sauce.\\

-- On peut se passer de l'ail, tu ne crois pas ? dit Marcel avec un air incertain.\\

Aude le regarda, puis regarda la grande marmite contenant la sauce.\\

-- Tu n'aimes pas l'ail ?\\

-- Non, je trouve ça un peu fort.\\

Ils échangèrent un regard complice, et Aude haussa les épaules avant de poser l'ail sur la table.\\

-- Ça ne fera de mal à personne s'il manque un ingrédient, hein ? dit-elle avec un sourire.\\

-- Personne n'a besoin de savoir qu'il manque un ingrédient d'ailleurs, répondit Marcel.\\

Ils se serrèrent la main puis continuèrent leur travail : Aude ajoutait les ingrédients tandis que Marcel remuait la sauce sur le feu.\\

De l'autre côté de l'usine, Hervé râpait le fromage et, un peu comme Cyril l'aurait fait, prit soin de le goûter.\\

-- Juste pour vérifier si c'est de la bonne qualité… se dit-il.\\

Lorsque toutes les tâches principales furent accomplies, le groupe d'enfants passa à la cuisson des garnitures. Cyril insista pour une partie poulet-champignons, Aude et Capucine voulaient des poivrons et du pepperoni, Hervé opta pour une garniture italienne avec basilic, olives et mozzarella, et Marcel surprit tout le monde en choisissant de mettre de l'ananas dans une partie.\\

-- À chacun sa tasse ! dit-il.\\

Ils firent cuire le tout avant de mettre la sauce, la garniture et le fromage sur les quartiers de pâte, puis transférèrent les morceaux au four sur un grand chariot. Lorsqu'une délicieuse odeur emplit l'usine, indiquant que les parties de pizza étaient prêtes, ils les sortirent prudemment, les mirent un à un sur un grand plan de travail, puis les poussèrent côte à côte pour former un grand disque de pizza.\\

Ils se regardèrent, fatigués, souriants, et surtout fiers de leur travail.\\

-- Qui a faim ?\\

Une voix mélodieuse interrompit le rêve éveillé des cinq enfants. Hervé se tourna vers sa mère, perchée sur l'escalier de la cabane.\\

-- Ça vous dit d'aller manger au resto rapide ? leur demanda-t-elle.\\

Les cinq amis acceptèrent l'offre avec enthousiasme et lui dirent qu'ils savaient déjà ce qu'ils voulaient : une pizza !\\

\begin{enumerate}

(French) (Reading Comprehension Exercise) D G (With Answer)

Oxy, couché sur le ventre avec la tête, la queue et les oreilles baissées, regardait tristement sa maîtresse, Alice, qui était en train de faire ses valises. Elle allait partir en voyage d'affaires et le laisser seul à la maison.\\

-- J'ai demandé à la voisine de venir te nourrir pendant mon absence et elle m'a assurée qu'elle prendra soin de toi, lui avait dit Alice en l'informant de ses projets. Elle lui avait promis qu'elle ne tarderait pas, qu'elle s'absenterait pendant quatre jours seulement, qu'elle aurait préféré l'emmener avec elle mais qu'elle n'avait pas assez de temps pour régler ses papiers. Elle lui promit également qu'elle lui rapporterait des jouets et des gâteries à son retour, mais rien de cela ne le rassurait, surtout après ce que son ami, le chien errant du quartier, lui avait dit.\\

-- Ne la crois pas, mes maîtres m'avaient dit la même chose avant de m'abandonner, l'avait mis en garde Rex.\\

Quand Oxy lui avait demandé ce qu'il lui suggérait de faire, Rex lui répondit de se cacher dans les bagages d'Alice.\\

-- Comme ça, tu iras avec elle, et elle n'aura pas la chance de t'abandonner !\\

Oxy n'était pas sûr ; il pensait qu'Alice serait en colère s'il faisait cela sans sa permission, et il ne voulait pas être un vilain chien, mais il ne voulait pas non plus devenir un chien abandonné ! Il observa attentivement sa maîtresse ranger ses vêtements dans sa valise et conclut qu'il pourrait s'y glisser discrètement grâce à sa petite taille. Lorsque sa maîtresse alla se coucher, il ouvrit la valise et s'installa à l'intérieur pour tester l'espace. Rassuré, il ressortit et alla dormir.\\

Le matin, il se leva en entendant les mouvements d'Alice qui faisait sa toilette. Elle remplit sa gamelle, l'emmena faire sa promenade, puis l'embrassa avant de partir. Oxy en profita pour se cacher dans la valise de sa maîtresse. Il se glissa entre ses vêtements pour éviter d'être repéré et resta silencieux. Il entendit Alice tirer la fermeture éclair de la valise et sentit les mouvements lorsqu'elle la souleva pour la mettre dans la malle du taxi.\\

Dans l'aéroport, Oxy sentit l'odeur d'un autre chien près de lui et entendit l'animal lui parler.\\

-- Je sais qu'il y a un chien à l'intérieur ; je veux juste te prévenir qu'il y a un scanner ici, et ils peuvent savoir que tu es là-dedans. Un conseil : si tu ne veux pas être repéré, sors de là, et je vais te dire comment monter à bord de l'avion.\\

Oxy, craignant d'avoir des ennuis, sortit le bout de son museau et vit un chien dans une caisse de transport qui lui faisait face. Oxy se présenta, et l'autre chien fit de même, l'informant que son nom était Louis.\\

-- Voilà ce que tu vas faire…\\

Louis lui expliqua comment esquiver les “gardiens” de l'aéroport et lui fit promettre de l'aider à ouvrir la porte de sa caisse une fois à bord de l'avion.\\

-- Je vais même partager le contenu de mes gamelles avec toi ! promit-il.\\

Une demi-heure plus tard, Oxy sentit Alice soulever sa valise. Peu après, il entendit l'aboiement de Louis, qui tentait de distraire les humains ; il le prit comme son signal pour sortir de la valise avant qu'elle ne passe au scanner de l'aéroport. Il se cacha, puis se faufila pour retourner à l'intérieur de la valise une fois celle-ci scannée.\\

-- Oxy ?\\

Il entendit Louis appeler une fois à bord du compartiment à bagages de l'avion et sortit de la valise de sa maîtresse. Il se dirigea vers son nouvel ami et tira sur le fermoir de sa caisse.\\

-- Ouf ! Ça commençait à devenir lassant de rester là-dedans ! dit Louis en lui donnant un coup de tête affectueux. Content que tu y sois parvenu, mon grand ! Allez, viens ! On va se promener un peu.\\

Les deux chiens explorèrent le compartiment, observant les bagages et les autres animaux à bord : un hamster, un serpent, deux chats et deux oiseaux. Certains voulaient sortir de leurs cages pour se dégourdir, et Louis et Oxy les aidèrent, à condition qu'ils retournent dans leurs cages à l'atterrissage.\\

-- Cet endroit est gigantesque ! dit une perruche nommée Arc-en-Ciel, qui volait autour du compartiment.\\

-- Pourquoi n'as-tu pas rejoint ton maître en volant ? lui demanda Oxy.\\

-- Parce qu'il ne me laisse jamais sortir de ma cage, évidemment !\\

-- Pourquoi pas ?\\

-- Je pense qu'il a peur que je l'abandonne.\\

Les mots d'Arc-en-Ciel firent penser Oxy à Alice, et il se dit qu'elle aussi pourrait avoir peur d'être abandonnée. Il se sentit coupable et décida de ne plus se cacher.\\

Une fois l'avion atterri et les bagages déchargés, Oxy sortit de la valise et chercha Alice. Sentant son odeur derrière lui, il se retourna et courut vers elle.\\

-- Oxy ! s'exclama Alice en voyant son chien courir vers elle. Mais comment es-tu arrivé ici ?\\

Oxy lui lécha le menton, et elle rigola.\\

-- Petit coquin ! Allez, viens, on va voir si l'hôtel acceptera de te laisser rester avec moi.\\

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Quel est le nom de la maîtresse d'Oxy ?
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item[A.] Alison
        \item[B.] Suzanne

(French) (Reading Comprehension Exercise) D G (With Answer)

Sous le soleil brillant de l'été, deux filles jouaient joyeusement ensemble à la marelle. Charlotte et Ines étaient meilleures amies. Elles étaient inséparables et se sentaient chanceuses d'être dans la même classe et d'habiter dans le même quartier. Elles se connaissaient depuis leurs jours passés dans le bac à sable et s'imaginaient qu'elles resteraient meilleures amies jusqu'à la mort. Les deux filles s'aimaient beaucoup et étaient proches comme des sœurs.\\

Ce matin, Ines avait ramené de la craie et proposé à sa copine de jouer au fameux jeu. Charlotte accepta avec enthousiasme et se mit à chercher un caillou pendant qu'Ines traçait le plateau de jeu. Une fois que tout était prêt, leur partie commença. Ines jeta le caillou sur la première case et commença à faire le parcours à cloche-pied. Lorsqu'elle fit son retour et tenta de lancer le caillou sur la deuxième case, celui-ci atterrit sur la troisième, et elle passa son tour.\\

Un peu plus tard, quand Ines prit de nouveau son tour, Charlotte interrompit son parcours en lui disant qu'elle avait marché sur le trait.\\

-- Mais non, j'étais assez loin des bords de la case, protesta Ines.\\

-- Mais si, tu ne l'as peut-être pas vu toi-même, mais d'où je suis, c'était clair que tu avais marché dessus ! insista Charlotte.\\

-- Tu es sûre que tu ne dis pas ça juste pour avoir ton tour ? dit Ines, plissant les yeux avec suspicion.\\

-- Bien sûr que non, comment peux-tu dire ça ! répondit Charlotte en fronçant les sourcils.\\

Leur discussion se transforma vite en conflit, et les deux filles finirent par se disputer. Par entêtement, aucune d'elles ne quitta l'aire de jeux ni ne continua à jouer. Elles s'assirent, le dos tourné l'une vers l'autre, boudant en silence, jusqu'à ce qu'une vieille dame vînt les saluer.\\

-- Bonjour Ines, bonjour Charlotte. Comment allez-vous, mes petites ?\\

-- Bonjour, Madame Morel, dirent-elles en même temps, ajoutant qu'elles allaient bien avant de lui demander de ses nouvelles.\\

-- Je vais bien, merci, sourit Mme Morel gentiment. J'étais en train de ranger mon grenier, et je me demandais si vous voudriez bien me donner un coup de main. Peut-être y trouverez-vous quelque chose qui vous plairait, même si ça date de plusieurs décennies.\\

Bien qu'elles ne se parlent pas, et malgré leur mauvaise humeur, les deux filles étaient trop polies pour refuser d'aider leur vieille voisine et acceptèrent de l'aider.\\

-- Excellent, je vous remercie ! Je vais passer un coup de fil à vos mères pour les informer que vous êtes chez moi, dit Mme Morel, leur promettant aussi des brownies en récompense.\\

Une fois chez la vieille dame, les deux filles commencèrent à trier les objets du grenier, mettant d'un côté ce qui devait être jeté et de l'autre ce qui pourrait encore servir. Elles ne savaient pas si Mme Morel voulait garder, donner, ou vendre ces objets, alors elles préféraient la laisser décider. Pendant une demi-heure, elles ne se dirent pas un mot, jusqu'à ce que Mme Morel vînt vérifier si tout allait bien.\\

-- Faites attention ! Aidez-vous pour soulever les objets lourds, sinon vous risquez de vous blesser, leur dit-elle avant de les rejoindre dans le ménage du grenier.\\

Avec leur vieille voisine dans la pièce, les deux filles commencèrent à se parler, ne serait-ce que pour demander de l'aide de temps en temps. Quelques instants plus tard, Mme Morel les appela pour voir le contenu d'une boîte en carton.\\

-- Ce sont vos jouets ? demanda Charlotte en saisissant une petite poupée.\\

-- Certains, oui. D'autres étaient ceux de mes enfants, répondit Mme Morel avec un sourire nostalgique. Ça, par exemple, dit-elle en leur montrant un gros ressort coloré, appartenait à ma fille aînée, Marie.\\

Elle tendit le ressort à Ines, qui le regarda avec fascination avant de le passer à son amie.\\

-- Et ce jeu de dominos appartenait à mon plus jeune fils, ajouta-t-elle en sortant une petite boîte en bois.\\

-- Et ça ? dit Charlotte en pointant un petit livret du doigt.\\

-- Ah ! s'exclama Mme Morel avec joie en sortant le livret de la boîte. C'est un album photo rempli de souvenirs avec ma meilleure amie.\\

Mme Morel ouvrit le petit album et leur montra des photos d'elle et de son amie d'enfance, capturant des moments de leur enfance jusqu'à l'adolescence.\\

-- Vous aviez l'air tellement heureuses ! s'exclama Ines, trouvant les sourires des deux filles dans les photos contagieux.\\

-- On l'était, dit la vieille dame doucement. On était aussi proches que vous l'êtes aujourd'hui.\\

Charlotte, remarquant que Mme Morel avait conjugué son verbe au passé, lui demanda si elles avaient perdu contact.\\

-- Non, nous sommes restées meilleures amies jusqu'à la fin. L'an dernier, mon amie est décédée.\\

-- Oh…\\

Charlotte se sentit coupable d'avoir rappelé quelque chose de triste à Mme Morel et baissa les yeux.\\

-- Je suis désolée, dit-elle.\\

-- Ce n'est pas ta faute, ma chérie. Et puis, nous avons eu toute notre vie pour nous aimer et nous amuser, dit la vieille dame en prenant les deux filles dans ses bras. Maintenant, c'est à votre tour de vous faire de bons souvenirs.\\

Ines et Charlotte se regardèrent timidement, un peu embarrassées par leur dispute, et échangèrent un sourire. Petit à petit, elles recommencèrent à se parler comme les meilleures amies qu'elles étaient.\\

-- Regarde ça ! dit Ines à sa copine en lui montrant une paire de raquettes de plage.\\

-- Oh ! Tu crois que Mme Morel nous laissera les garder ?\\

La dame en personne les rejoignit avec un plateau contenant deux grands verres de lait et une assiette remplie de brownies.\\

-- Bien sûr que vous pouvez les garder !\\

(French) (Reading Comprehension Exercise) D G (With Answer)

Pingouin regardait autour de lui avec crainte et curiosité. Il se laissait emporter par tout ce qu'il voyait dans la volière : il comprenait l'intérêt des perchoirs, des mangeoires et des points d'eau, mais, à son avis, les barreaux n'étaient pas nécessaires. Il se dit que là où il avait l'habitude de traîner, personne ne pouvait voler de toute façon, avec ou sans barreaux.\\

Ses pensées furent interrompues par la rapide descente d'un oiseau. C'était un faucon à l'apparence majestueuse et aux yeux perçants. L'oiseau se tourna vers lui, le regarda et le salua d'un hochement de tête avant de rediriger son regard droit devant lui, tel un bon soldat. Un moment plus tard, une chouette les rejoignit. Elle ne prêta attention à aucun d'entre eux et se percha en silence. Pingouin la regarda avant de détourner son regard vers le faucon et ne sut qui l'intimidait le plus. Une chose était sûre : les deux étaient impressionnants, surtout comparés à lui.\\

-- Désolé pour le retard, messieurs dames ! Pingouin entendit avant de voir un corbeau atterrir à côté de lui. Contrairement aux autres oiseaux aux yeux menaçants, ce corbeau avait un regard espiègle et un peu moqueur. Il sourit à Pingouin et lui fit un clin d'œil. Pingouin, ne sachant que dire, se contenta de sourire au corbeau maladroitement. Certes, il n'était pas aussi intimidant que les deux autres, mais il avait du charisme.\\

Après quelques instants de silence, un grand aigle descendit sur les quatre animaux et s'installa sur le grand perchoir au centre de la volière. L'oiseau, déjà immense, paraissait encore plus imposant de cette position. Pingouin le regarda avec émerveillement, non seulement parce qu'il était le plus grand oiseau présent, mais parce qu'il avait un regard strict et une posture droite qui commandait l'attention de tous dans la volière.\\

-- Bonjour et merci pour votre présence aujourd'hui, dit-il d'une voix rauque.\\

-- Ce n'est pas comme si on avait le choix, on a pratiquement été convoqués, hein ? murmura Corbeau à Pingouin en le poussant du coude avec complicité, avant de se redresser en voyant le regard irrité de l'aigle fixé sur lui.\\

Les quatre oiseaux savaient bien ce qui arrivait aux animaux convoqués par les autorités : ils devenaient agents pour protéger le zoo et partaient en missions secrètes pour libérer des animaux capturés et maltraités par des humains.\\

-- Je suis Maître Aigle, votre commandant. Je vais superviser vos entraînements et vos missions. Chacun d'entre vous a été convoqué pour son talent et son potentiel. Même si vous êtes habitués à vivre parmi les vôtres, vous êtes tous différents, et pour cela, vous allez apprendre à travailler en équipe et à survivre ensemble dans différents environnements.\\

Pingouin pensa que cela était vrai pour les autres oiseaux : même Corbeau semblait spécial à sa manière. Mais il doutait d'avoir lui-même du “talent et du potentiel” comme Maître Aigle l'avait dit.\\

-- Peut-être que je suis censé leur ramener de l'eau après leurs entraînements, pensa-t-il, distrait.\\

Après que Maître Aigle eut fini de parler, le grillage de la volière se transforma pour prendre l'apparence de murs sombres et métalliques, chassant la lumière du jour hors de la pièce. Les perchoirs prirent un aspect bleu lumineux et plusieurs écrans s'allumèrent.\\

-- Votre première mission aura lieu dans un environnement forestier. Assurez-vous de vous nourrir, de vous protéger et de prendre soin les uns des autres. Si l'un de vous échoue, toute l'équipe échoue.\\

Leur première mission se passa bien, tout comme les deux suivantes, qui eurent lieu dans un désert et dans une cité. Faucon et Chouette utilisèrent leurs talents de chasseurs, et Corbeau, son intelligence et sa ruse pour trouver de la nourriture. Pingouin, ne mangeant pas les mêmes choses qu'eux, pouvait jeûner grâce à ses réserves de graisse et ne leur causa pas de problème sur ce point. Cependant, il n'était ni capable de se battre ni de chasser. Même si ses coéquipiers ne lui faisaient jamais de remarques blessantes, il se sentait inutile.\\

Leur quatrième mission se déroula en Antarctique, un endroit couvert de neige et de glace. Il n'y avait presque pas de proies à chasser ni d'endroits pour s'abriter. Le seul qui s'intégrait parfaitement à l'environnement était Pingouin avec son ventre blanc.\\

-- Je ne vois rien, dit Faucon, inquiet.\\

-- Rien que du blanc, tu veux dire, dit Corbeau en riant un peu.\\

-- Eh bien, il n'y a pas grand-chose à voir. La plupart des animaux ici ont une fourrure blanche, ce qui ne facilite pas les choses, expliqua Pingouin. Mais on peut pêcher ! Il y a plein de poissons, et vous pouvez tous en manger, n'est-ce pas ?\\

-- Oui, mais on n'est pas tous capables de plonger sous l'eau, et la glace ne me permet pas d'attraper les poissons en surface, répondit Faucon.\\

-- Je vais pêcher pour vous ! Je suis très doué pour ça, dit Pingouin, content de pouvoir enfin se rendre utile.\\

Il plongea sous l'eau et nagea à grande vitesse, remontant régulièrement pour déposer des poissons pour ses coéquipiers. Après un moment, il avait accumulé un tas de poissons qu'il partagea avec eux.\\

Quand ils retournèrent à la volière, Pingouin comprit que même lui, qui n'était pas aussi majestueux et fort que les autres, avait ses points forts. Leur équipe termina la formation et ils devinrent officiellement des agents de la volière.\\

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Où se trouvait Pingouin au début de l'histoire ?
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item[A.] Dans une volière

(French) (Reading Comprehension Exercise) D G (With Answer)

Maman ferma le livre d'histoire, le posa sur la table de chevet d'Angela et s'approcha d'elle pour lui embrasser le front.\\

-- Bonne nuit ma chérie, dit-elle en la couvrant avec sa couette.\\

Angela lui souhaita bonne nuit et la regarda éteindre la lumière avant de sortir en laissant la porte entre-ouverte. Elle leva la tête et se mit à admirer les étoiles lumineuses projetées par sa lampe, défilant lentement sur le plafond de sa chambre. En les regardant, Angela se rappela d'un détail tiré de l'histoire de cette nuit : un vieux nain avait dit au prince qu'un arc-en-ciel était en réalité un pont, un portail en quelque sorte, qui conduisait à un univers merveilleux où on pouvait trouver tout ce que l'on désire. Un monde fantastique de magie, de beauté et d'aventures.\\

Cette partie de l'histoire l'avait intéressée bien plus que le reste, et elle se demanda dans quel genre de monde elle atterrirait si elle venait un jour à croiser un arc-en-ciel. Y aurait-il des dragons ? Des fées ? Des sirènes ? Angela rêvassa un peu sur ce sujet avant de s'endormir avec un sourire rêveur.\\

Le matin, réveillée par son alarme bruyante, elle se rappela de ses rêves d'aventure. Elle aurait tellement aimé explorer de nouveaux mondes plutôt que d'aller en classe. Elle fit un vœu de voir un arc-en-ciel, sortit de son lit et alla se préparer. Une fois prête, elle salua ses parents, prit son petit-déjeuner, et se rendit à l'école. Sa journée était très ordinaire, sans événements particuliers. Elle suivit ses cours, joua avec ses amis à la récréation, et prit son déjeuner à la cantine.\\

À l'heure de rentrer, il se mit à pleuvoir, et Angela dut attendre car elle n'avait pas pris de parapluie. Surprise, elle se dit que c'était étrange pour une journée annoncée ensoleillée. Finalement, lorsque la pluie cessa, elle se mit en route pour chez elle. En évitant les flaques d'eau, elle aperçut le reflet de quelque chose de coloré dans l'une d'elles. Elle leva la tête et vit un arc-en-ciel. Ses yeux s'agrandirent d'émerveillement en se rappelant de ce qu'elle avait imaginé la veille au soir.\\

Angela regarda autour d'elle, mais il n'y avait personne pour partager sa joie. Elle soupira, se disant qu'il aurait été merveilleux de pouvoir traverser l'arc-en-ciel pour se retrouver dans un autre monde. Distraitement, elle traversa la flaque d'eau et se sentit soudain poussée par un vent violent qui la fit tomber.\\

-- Ouille ! s'écria-t-elle.\\

Elle ouvrit les yeux, mais resta allongée sur le sol, qui ne lui parut pas aussi dur qu'elle l'aurait cru. La première chose qu'elle vit était un ciel bleu clair qui passait graduellement à un rose pastel. Fronçant les sourcils, elle réalisa que le ciel était différent d'il y a deux minutes ! Elle aperçut trois grands cercles blancs presque transparents et entendit le bruissement des feuilles, le chant des oiseaux, et le doux ruissellement de l'eau. Elle se releva et découvrit avec stupéfaction qu'elle se trouvait dans une grande plaine couverte de fleurs et d'arbres, baignant dans des senteurs d'herbe et de fleurs qu'elle n'avait jamais rencontrées.\\

Elle remarqua qu'elle voyait, sentait et entendait tout avec une intensité décuplée. Quand elle se pencha sur une petite rivière pour boire, elle vit son reflet : ses cheveux avaient des reflets arc-en-ciel, et ses yeux verts brillaient d'un éclat vif. Ses vêtements avaient changé également, et elle portait une tunique bleue foncée, un pantalon blanc et des bottes marron.\\

Elle n'eut pas le temps de boire car son attention fut capturée par le reflet d'un dragon de feu volant au-dessus d'elle. Elle se tourna pour voir la créature et sentit sa chaleur passer dans l'air avec grâce.\\

-- Mais où suis-je ? murmura-t-elle, bouche bée.\\

-- Eh bien, à Galazio, évidemment ! répondit une voix joviale.\\

Angela sursauta, cherchant autour d'elle l'origine de cette voix.\\

-- Je suis là, un peu plus bas ! dit la voix.\\

Elle baissa les yeux et aperçut une minuscule femme assise sur le pétale d'un coquelicot. Bien qu'elle la voyait bien, Angela s'agenouilla pour observer de plus près.\\

-- Ne viens pas trop près, ou je vais attraper froid avec tes expirations ! rit la petite femme.\\

-- Vous… êtes une fée ? demanda Angela en s'éloignant.\\

-- Exactement !\\

Angela se présenta et la fée se nomma Emmeline, ou Em pour les intimes. Elles discutèrent, et Angela demanda s'il y avait d'autres créatures magiques sur Galazio. Em lui parla des dragons, des elfes, des licornes et même d'humains comme elle. Curieuse, Angela demanda si elle était censée combattre des créatures maléfiques, mais Em la rassura : Galazio était une planète paisible.\\

-- Peut-être que tu peux aller explorer des terres lointaines ? proposa Angela.\\

-- Je… ne pense pas. Cette planète est minuscule, répondit Em avec un sourire amusé. Mais tu peux aller à l'école !\\

Angela soupira.\\

-- Quand puis-je rentrer chez moi ? demanda-t-elle.\\

Em lui expliqua que les arcs-en-ciel, servant de portail, n'apparaissent qu'une fois tous les quinze jours. Déçue, Angela soupira. Em, cherchant à lui remonter le moral, lui proposa de faire le tour de Galazio et de se faire des amis en attendant.\\

Angela rencontra les dragons aux couleurs flamboyantes, les licornes aux crinières colorées, et les autres habitants de Galazio, tous bienveillants. Elle fut invitée à un grand dîner où elle découvrit que tout avait un goût plus prononcé ici. Elle dansa avec les enfants de Galazio, mais se sentit soudain triste en voyant les autres rentrer avec leurs parents.\\

-- Allez, viens ! Madame Maeva t'a préparé une chambre. Au lit ! dit Em.\\

Une fois dans son lit, Angela fixa le plafond, regrettant de ne pas y voir les étoiles de sa chambre. Elle se surprit à souhaiter se réveiller chez elle. Le lendemain, elle ouvrit les yeux et poussa un soupir en se voyant encore à Galazio. Elle rejoignit Em dans le jardin, mais un dragon de feu passa rapidement devant elle, et elle trébucha.\\

-- Attention ! cria la jeune fée.\\

Angela entendit la voix de Mme Rolland, son institutrice, et ouvrit soudain les yeux pour découvrir qu'elle était dans sa classe.\\

-- Je suis de retour, chuchota-t-elle, regardant ses vêtements d'uniforme. Quand la cloche sonna, elle courut chez elle et embrassa ses parents.\\

Il est vrai qu'il n'y avait ni dragons ni fées ici, mais elle était chez elle, et c'était tout ce qui comptait.

(French) (Reading Comprehension Exercise) D G (With Answer)

Un bel après-midi, trois chatons jouaient près de leurs jeunes propriétaires, qui écoutaient une histoire que leur mère leur racontait. C'était une histoire qui parlait des aventures d'un astronaute, et bien qu'ils ne prêtassent pas beaucoup d'attention à ce qu'elle disait, leur intérêt fut capturé lorsqu'ils entendirent les mots : \textit{voie lactée}.\\

-- La voie lactée ? dit Monocle, une adorable chatonne avec un œil encerclé de gris. Est-ce qu'elle veut dire un chemin couvert complètement de lait ?\\

Oto, le plus jeune d'entre eux, se redressa en imaginant ce qu'elle venait de dire, et Farfouille, leur grand frère, fixa ses yeux avec fascination.\\

-- Tu imagines si cet endroit existait vraiment ?\\

Les trois chatons furent transportés dans un univers fictif, où, dans un vaisseau spatial sombre et étroit, le commandant Farfouille, l'officier scientifique Oto, et la mécanicienne navigante Monocle étaient assis l'un à côté de l'autre. Ils naviguaient leur navette à travers le cosmos, sérieux et silencieux. Leur mission : trouver la voie lactée légendaire et en ramener des échantillons ; ils n'avaient pas l'intention d'échouer.\\

Ils s'arrêtèrent près d'une station spatiale pour s'informer sur le chemin à prendre et téléchargèrent un guide spatial qu'ils chargèrent dans le système de leur vaisseau. Après s'être assurés qu'ils avaient assez de carburant et de provisions, ils reprirent leur vol. Farfouille pilota l'engin, Oto fit des recherches sur leur destination, et Monocle surveilla la condition de la navette.\\

Au bout d'un moment, elle remarqua un point clignotant sur le radar et le signala à ses coéquipiers.\\

-- Doit-on les attaquer, commandant ? demanda-t-elle en se tournant vers Farfouille.\\

-- Hmm... Ce sont nos ennemis jurés, mais ils semblent se diriger vers une autre destination. Mieux vaut nous occuper de nos propres affaires et les ignorer, répondit le commandant sans quitter l'écran du radar des yeux.\\

-- Vous ne pensez pas qu'ils veulent goûter aux délices de la voie lactée eux aussi ? demanda Oto, sa queue frémissante.\\

-- Non, ils visent probablement le fromage de la Lune. Ils ont des goûts bien excentriques, répondit Farfouille.\\

-- N'oubliez pas que ces rats s'en prennent à tout, commandant. Ils viendront probablement vers nous après leur arrêt sur la Lune, ajouta Monocle.\\

-- Si c'est le cas, ils deviendront notre repas du soir, dit Farfouille d'un ton assuré.\\

Oto et Monocle hochèrent la tête et se concentrèrent sur leurs tâches, tandis que le commandant continuait à diriger le vaisseau vers la fameuse rivière de lait flottante, au beau milieu de l'espace. Les trois chatons étaient de fameux aventuriers de l'espace.\\

Farfouille, naturellement curieux et intrépide, aimait explorer l'univers ; Oto aimait apprendre et expérimenter ; et Monocle trouvait leurs aventures amusantes et saisissait toutes les occasions de bricoler à bord de la navette.\\

Une fois arrivés à destination, les trois chatons enfilèrent leurs combinaisons spatiales et descendirent du vaisseau. Ils flottèrent jusqu'à atteindre la rivière de lait miraculeuse. La voie lactée était majestueuse, son lait d'un blanc éclatant dégageait une douce lueur, illuminant l'espace alentour.\\

-- Chat-pristi ! murmura Oto, émerveillé.\\

-- Je n'en crois pas mes yeux, c'est incroyable ! s'exclama Monocle, tout à fait d'accord avec son frère.\\

-- Si seulement on pouvait enlever nos casques ! miaula Farfouille avec regret. On aurait pu goûter au lait directement de la source !\\

Oto tendit la patte pour toucher le lait et constata qu'il était agréablement chaud.\\

-- On dit que ce lait est infusé avec de la poussière d'étoile !\\

-- C'est donc pour ça qu'il brille autant !\\

-- Oui, et je pense que c'est aussi ce qui le garde à bonne température.\\

-- Trêve de bavardage ! les interrompit Farfouille impatiemment. Sortez les aspirateurs et commençons à remplir les réservoirs.\\

Oto et Monocle plongèrent de longs tubes-aspirateurs dans la rivière et commencèrent à pomper le lait vers les réservoirs de leur navette spatiale, tandis que Farfouille surveillait les niveaux. Soudain, Monocle aperçut un étrange signal sur son radar portable.\\

-- On dirait qu'un vaisseau s'approche à toute vitesse !\\

-- Restez ici, je vais vérifier sur le radar de bord. Je suis sûr que ce n'est rien, dit Farfouille.\\

Quelques instants plus tard, il ordonna à Oto et Monocle de retourner à bord du vaisseau.\\

-- C'est la navette des rats, ils viennent nous attaquer !\\

Lorsque les rongeurs approchèrent, Farfouille visa et commença à tirer sur eux avec les armes laser de la navette.\\

-- Monocle, tâche d'esquiver leurs attaques pendant qu'Oto et moi ripostons, ordonna Farfouille.\\

Comment osaient ces vermines les attaquer, et près de la voie lactée sacrée en plus ! Il n'était pas question de les laisser contaminer cette rivière de lait légendaire.\\

Après une longue bataille, les rats battirent en retraite, et la voie lactée fut sauvée par les courageux chatons de l'espace.\\

-- Mais qu'est-ce qu'ils font ? demanda une voix.\\

Les chatons relevèrent la tête et virent leurs jeunes propriétaires les regarder avec confusion. Monocle sortit de la boîte en carton où ils jouaient et se dirigea vers sa jeune humaine. Farfouille et Oto firent de même, et les trois chatons ronronnèrent sous les caresses affectueuses de leurs amis humains.\\

-- Allez, rentrons ! Je suis sûre qu'ils ont faim, donnons-leur un peu de lait, dit l'humaine de Monocle à ses frères.

Théo regardait l'écran de la télévision avec attention en buvant le chocolat chaud que Maman lui avait apportée. \\
Il regardait un dessin animé sur des enfants qui avaient pris une potion magique et étaient devenus minuscules pour explorer le corps de leur ami malade et découvrir ce qui l'avait mis dans cet état. \\
À la fin du dessin animé, les enfants avaient neutralisé le virus qui avait causé la grippe de leur copain et celui-ci avait fini par guérir. \\

Le concept avait fasciné Théo et il se dit qu'il aurait aimé que ce genre d'excursion puisse être réel. \\
Ses pensées furent interrompues par sa petite sœur qui laissa échapper un soupir triste en posant la poupée avec laquelle elle jouait. \\
Théo la regarda et se demanda si, comme les enfants du dessin animé avaient exploré un corps humain, il serait possible d'explorer l'esprit d'une personne. \\

Dans le dessin animé, le corps du petit garçon était formé de vaisseaux sanguins et d'organes. Théo imagina que ce serait pareil pour tous les corps. \\
Tout le monde a des mains, des jambes, une tête et un cœur après tout, mais est-ce que c'était pareil pour les esprits ? \\
Est-ce que tout le monde pense aux mêmes choses ? \\
Certainement pas ! \\
Théo le savait bien. \\
Son amie Béatrice n'aimait pas les mêmes choses que lui et ils ont souvent des idées différentes. \\
Il avait aussi remarqué que ses camarades de classes avaient de différents intérêts, c'était clair lorsque l'institutrice leur demandait de lire leurs expressions écrites. \\

Théo se laissa emporter par son imagination et essaya de deviner à quoi ressemblerait l'esprit de sa petite sœur. \\
Il se trouva dans un bac à sable géant plein de jouets. \\
Le ciel était rose pâle, il y avait une douce odeur de shampoing à la fraise, et il entendit le son de la musique de la berceuse que sa mère chantait souvent à sa sœur. \\
Il marcha un peu à travers le bac à sable et vit une balançoire dans un coin, des peluches dans un autre, et un camion de glace entre les deux coins. \\

Lorsqu'il avança davantage, il vit des dessins colorés de leur famille que sa sœur avait dessinés et quelques vieux objets comme son doudou et une paire de chaussures qu'elle adorait quand elle était plus jeune et en conclut que cette partie du bac à sable représentait ses souvenirs. \\

\begin{quote}
    \textit{-Eh bien, c'est un endroit drôlement coloré…} se dit-il une fois qu'il avait fait le tour complet.
\end{quote}

En revenant à la réalité, son attention fut capturée par le bruit de froissement du journal que Papa était en train de lire, et il décida d'imaginer à quoi l'esprit de ce dernier ressemblait. \\
Il se trouva dans un endroit fermé aux murs gris. \\
Il y avait un bureau, une chaise, et plein de casiers. \\
L'endroit était calme et silencieux, et il y avait une forte odeur de café dans l'air. \\

Il se demanda distraitement si Papa serait en colère contre lui s'il fouillait dans les tiroirs, puis se rappela que cet endroit est issu de son imagination à lui. \\
Il s'assied sur la chaise et vit qu'il y avait un ordinateur portable fermé, un stylo et des feuilles, un cadre contenant la photo de la famille — le seul élément de couleurs dans la pièce — et une barre de chocolat. \\
Il rigola en voyant le dernier objet et pensa que son père aurait sûrement du chocolat noir dans son bureau au travail. \\

Il se leva pour aller voir ce qu'il y avait dans les tiroirs des casiers et vit qu'il y avait des étiquettes avec les mots : Famille, travail, sport, et plein d'autres sujets écrits sur eux. \\
Le casier de la famille contenait des tiroirs pour chaque membre de la famille et quand il ouvrit le sien, il y trouva des photos de lui lorsqu'il n'était qu'un bébé ainsi que des petites anecdotes écrites sur des feuilles triées dans des dossiers. \\
Il y avait également un tiroir qui contenait les souvenirs de Papa et il y trouva ses photos d'enfance et de jeunesse. \\

\begin{quote}
    \textit{-Quelle bonne mémoire !} murmura-t-il.
\end{quote}

Il savait déjà que son père était très organisé et il se dit que son imagination avait fait un bon travail en composant cet endroit pour refléter l'esprit de son père. \\

Il se mit ensuite à penser à quoi ressemblerait l'esprit de sa jolie Maman et fut transporté dans une grande pièce éclairée par la chaleureuse lumière du soleil. \\
Il y avait une bonne odeur de cookies et de fleurs. \\
Il entendit une très belle musique jouée au piano et vit plein de photos de lui, sa sœur, et son père sur les trois murs de couleur vert pâle, le quatrième étant formé de vitres qui s'étendaient du sol au plafond et qui lui permettaient de voir un grand jardin plein d'arbres et de fleurs. \\

Il retourna son attention vers la pièce et remarqua pour la première fois un meuble en bois plein de livres : des romans, des recueils de poésie, des livres d'histoire, des revues scientifiques, et même des livres pour enfants. \\

\begin{quote}
    \textit{-Je sais déjà ce que je vais lui acheter pour son anniversaire,} dit-il en rigolant.
\end{quote}

Lorsqu'il cessa de rêvasser, Théo pensa qu'il avait formé ces images en se basant sur ce qu'il connaissait déjà de sa famille. \\
Chaque endroit était plein de choses qu'ils aimaient, de couleurs qu'ils portaient, et de sons qu'ils aimaient entendre… ou ne pas entendre, dans le cas de Papa. \\
Mais… pensa-t-il, à quoi peut bien ressembler mon esprit à moi ?

Stéphanie fit tambouriner ses doigts sur son bureau, les yeux fixés sur la feuille blanche qui était posée au centre avec un stylo au-dessus. \\
\textit{-Mais qu'est-ce que je dois choisir ?} se demanda-t-elle en se penchant en arrière sur sa chaise avec un soupir. \\
Elle devait écrire un texte dans lequel elle décrit sa saison préférée et explique pourquoi elle l'aime tellement. C'était un devoir que leur enseignant leur avait demandé de faire et de rendre le lendemain. \\
Pour Stéfy, les expressions écrites étaient faciles et amusantes à faire, d'ailleurs c'était une des rares choses qu'elle aimait avoir comme devoir. \\
Le seul problème était qu'elle ne savait pas quoi choisir, elle aimait toutes les saisons et n'avait pas une qu'elle préférait. N'était-ce pas le but d'avoir quatre saisons en rotation, après tout, d'avoir l'occasion et le plaisir de les vivre toutes ? \\

Elle aimait la progression naturelle des saisons, elle aimait le froid et la pluie de l'hiver, les couleurs du printemps, la joie de l'été et la douceur de l'automne. \\
Après quelques moments de réflexion, elle décida de demander à ses parents quelle était leur saison préférée en espérant que ça l'aiderait à décider. \\
Papa avait dit qu'il aimait l'hiver et lorsque Stéfy lui avait demandé pourquoi pas les autres saisons, il avait dit que son allergie au pollen rendait le printemps pénible, qu'il y avait trop de mouches en automne et qu'il faisait trop chaud pendant l'été.\\
Maman avait choisi l'été simplement parce qu'elle pouvait faire la grasse matinée et ne devait pas se lever tôt pour préparer le petit déjeuner et conduire sa fille à l'école. \\

Pas vraiment convaincue par les raisons de ses parents, qui semblaient être plus pratiques qu'amusantes, Stéphanie alla parler avec ses amis. \\
Tous sauf un lui avaient dit qu'ils préféraient l'été parce que c'est la saison des vacances et qu'ils pouvaient jouer à volonté, n'avaient pas de devoirs, et en plus ils pouvaient aller à la plage. \\
Le dernier lui avait dit qu'il aimait l'automne parce qu'il aimait voir les feuilles des arbres changer de couleur et le vol des oiseaux qui partent en migration vers des régions plus chaudes. \\
Lorsqu'il lui demanda pourquoi elle voulait savoir, elle lui expliqua son problème. \\

\begin{quote}
\textit{-Je vois, alors ton souci c'est que tu ne peux pas faire un choix, c'est ça ?}\\
\textit{-Oui.}\\
\textit{-Alors, pourquoi n'écris-tu pas un texte qui contient toutes les saisons ? Une saison quatre-en-un en quelque sorte,} suggéra-t-il.
\end{quote}

Stéphanie tapota son doigt sur son menton et prit quelques instants pour penser à l'idée de son ami. \\
Ce n'était pas mal comme suggestion et l'enseignant n'avait pas précisé de règles qui pouvaient l'empêcher de le faire. Et puis, plus elle y pensait, plus elle avait envie de le faire, elle trouvait ça amusant d'imaginer une saison qui regroupe les quatre qui existent. \\
Elle remercia son ami puis rentra chez elle pour commencer son travail. \\

Elle s'assied sur sa chaise de bureau, ferma les yeux et commença à imaginer son monde où les saisons étaient fusionnées en une seule. \\
Elle imagina une belle forêt où les arbres avaient un feuillage tantôt vert de printemps, tantôt doré d'automne, certains arbres étaient recouverts de neige et d'autres portaient des fruits mûrs. \\
On y entendait le chant des oiseaux et des criquets, et on pouvait voir des abeilles et des papillons butiner les fleurs et les baies sur les buissons. Il ne faisait ni trop froid, ni trop chaud.\\

Stéphanie ouvrit soudainement les yeux et secoua la tête. \\
\begin{quote}
\textit{-Non, ce n'est pas vraiment excitant de mélanger le tout…} murmura-t-elle.
\end{quote}

Elle prit une pause et alla à la cuisine pour prendre son goûter et son regard fut capturé par l'assiette compartimentée qui contenait des condiments : il y avait de la mayonnaise, du ketchup, de la moutarde et du houmous. \\
En la regardant, Stéfy se demanda à quoi ressemblerait sa forêt imaginaire si elle était divisée comme cette assiette, avec les saisons à la place des condiments. \\

Elle s'assied sur l'une des chaises de la cuisine et se replongea dans son monde.\\
Si elle pouvait voir la forêt de haut, elle aurait pu remarquer que celle-ci avait des bordures distinctes cette fois : on pouvait clairement voir où une partie se termine pour laisser place à une autre. \\
Elle commença à explorer cet endroit et ne tarda pas à constater qu'elle était dans la partie où le printemps dominait. Il y avait plein de couleurs, l'air était frais et les sons des animaux animaient l'endroit. \\
Elle vit un écureuil courir d'un arbre à un autre et le suivit. \\

Lorsqu'elle le vit grimper, son attention fut détournée vers les pommes suspendues sur une branche et elle sentit un changement subtil dans la température de l'air. \\
\begin{quote}
\textit{-Ah, je vois, c'est l'été ici…} dit-elle avant de continuer en avant.
\end{quote}

Elle leva le bras pour se protéger les yeux des rayons de soleil qui transperçaient les feuilles des arbres, dessinant des motifs mystérieux avec des ombres et des lumières sur le sol. Un vent soudain la fit marcher plus rapidement et elle baissa son bras lorsqu'elle entendit le son des feuilles mortes sur lesquelles elle marchait. \\
Les arbres étaient à présent vêtus de feuilles jaunes, oranges, rouges et marrons, et elle sentit une odeur agréable de terre humide et de champignons. \\
Elle se pencha au bord d'une rivière et retira sa main aussitôt qu'elle l'étendit pour toucher l'eau. Elle regarda l'autre côté de la rivière et vit que les arbres étaient dévêtus de leurs feuillages et recouverts d'une épaisse couche de neige. \\

Lorsqu'elle ouvrit les yeux, elle sourit et prit une brioche au chocolat avant de retourner dans sa chambre pour transformer ses pensées en mots. \\

Le lendemain, lorsqu'elle lut son expression écrite, toute la classe, y compris son enseignant, l'applaudit chaleureusement, et tout le monde exprima son envie de visiter sa forêt quatre-saisons.

(French) (Reading Comprehension Exercise) D G (With Answer)

Marianne, assise sur la chaise de bureau de son grand frère, lui racontait avec enthousiasme qu'elle était élue par sa classe pour écrire un poème pour la compétition de son école. \\
Elle lui dit qu'elle voulait écrire quelque chose sur la nature et qu'elle voulait commencer immédiatement. \\
\textit{-Et bien, vas-y !} dit-il après avoir exprimé sa fierté d'elle. \textit{Je vais te prêter mon dictionnaire si tu veux !} Il l'encouragea. \\
Marianne rit avec amusement et lui dit qu'elle n'avait pas besoin d'un dictionnaire. \\
\textit{-Je n'ai pas été élue pour rien, voyons !} lui dit-elle. \textit{Je connais tous les mots, j'ai même gagné la compétition d'orthographe de mon école !} \\
Grand frère sourit et souleva un sourcil avec étonnement. \\
\textit{-Personne ne connaît tous les mots, Anne. Même les grands professeurs de littérature.} \\
\textit{-Et bien, tant pis pour eux ! Moi je sais que je les connais tous. Je comprends tous les mots dans mon livre de lecture et je n'ai jamais eu besoin d'un dictionnaire !} répondit la petite fille. \\
\textit{-Il est vrai que pour ton âge, tu as plus de connaissances que les autres en littérature, mais il y a sûrement quelques mots que tu ignores.} \\
\textit{-Non, aucun !} Grand frère adorait Marianne et ne voulait pas lui faire de peine, mais il ne voulait pas non plus qu'elle continue à penser qu'elle était arrivée au bout du chemin concernant son éducation. \\
Il était fier du fait qu'elle avait de la confiance en soi, mais il savait que ça pouvait très vite se transformer en arrogance et cela l'empêcherait d'apprendre davantage de choses à l'avenir. \\
Il était sûr qu'elle avait encore beaucoup à apprendre et il voulait l'aider. \\

Il passa quelques minutes à penser à une bonne méthode pour la corriger sans la vexer et finit par lui suggérer de lui apprendre des choses à lui. \\
\textit{-Contrairement à toi, je ne connais malheureusement pas tous les mots…} argumenta-t-il avec tristesse. \\
Marianne, qui aimait son grand frère et détestait le voir mécontent, accepta immédiatement de lui apprendre les mots qu'il ne connaissait pas. \\
\textit{-Peut-être que tu peux me donner des descriptions des choses dont tu ne connais pas le nom et je te dirai comment elles s'appellent.} \\
\textit{-C'est une très bonne idée !} dit-il avec joie. \textit{Tu sais quoi, il fait beau aujourd'hui. On devrait sortir dans le jardin, comme ça tu vas aussi être inspirée pour ton poème.} \\
Marianne accepta d'aller dehors et prit avec elle un petit carnet et un stylo, quant à son grand frère, il n'emporta que son téléphone portable avec lui. \\

Les deux s'installèrent sur le gazon et Marianne lui dit de commencer. \\
Grand frère, ne voulant pas la décourager, commença par quelque chose de plutôt facile. \\
\textit{-Tu sais ce qu'on appelle ça ?} dit-il en lui montrant les petites boules de tissu qui s'étaient formées sur son pull. \\
\textit{-Oh, ça, c'est de la bouloche !} répondit Marianne immédiatement. \\
\textit{-Je vois ! Et ces herbes que Maman utilise dans la cuisine ?} dit-il en pointant le doigt vers le petit jardin potager. \\
\textit{-Ce sont des aromates !} \\
\textit{-Tu peux me dire ce qu'on appelle une personne qui fait des acrobaties devant les gens dans la rue ?} \\
\textit{-Euh, un clown ? Un acrobate ?} \\
\textit{-Non, non, je crois qu'ils ont une autre appellation.} \\
\textit{-Je n'en connais pas d'autres,} répondit Marianne avec embarras. \\
\textit{-Ne t'inquiète pas, on va chercher sur internet.} Grand frère écrit quelques mots sur le clavier de son téléphone puis montra à Marianne le contenu de son écran. \\
\textit{-Ah, regarde là ! Ça s'appelle un saltimbanque.} \\
\textit{-Oh ! Bon, d'accord alors. Je ne connais pas un mot, ce n'est pas grave ! Vas-y ! Décris-moi autre chose !} dit-elle. \\
\textit{-Comment s'appelle le plat que Maman fait avec des haricots blancs et des saucissons ?} \\
\textit{-Le cassoulet !} \\
\textit{-Oh ! Et celui avec les choux fermentés ?} \\
\textit{-La choucroute !} Grand frère l'applaudit avec admiration. \\
\textit{-Tu peux me dire ce qu'on appelle l'élevage de lapins domestiques ?} \\
Marianne pensa un moment avant de dire qu'elle ne croyait pas qu'il y avait un mot pour ça, mais grand frère lui dit qu'il valait mieux vérifier quand même. \\
\textit{-Ah ! Là ! Cuniculture !} \\
\textit{-C'est mignon comme mot,} dit Marianne en rigolant. \\
\textit{-Bon, continuons,} dit grand frère. \textit{Comment s'appellent ces fleurs ?} dit-il en montrant de belles fleurs aux pétales roses. \\
\textit{-Des… euh, je ne sais pas,} répondit Marianne. \\

Il en prit une photo et lança une recherche basée sur images. \\
\textit{-Regarde, on dit ici que ça s'appelle des rhododendrons.} \\
\textit{-C'est un peu difficile à prononcer, hein ?} lui demanda-t-elle. \\
\textit{-Tout à fait. Reprenant, tu veux bien ?} \\
\textit{-Non… Tu sais… je ne suis plus aussi sûre que je connais tous les mots, après tout. J'en connais beaucoup, mais il y en a pas mal que je ne connais pas.} \\
\textit{-Ce n'est pas grave,} dit Grand Frère. \textit{Tu peux toujours les apprendre, tu es encore jeune. Peut-être que lorsque tu auras mon âge, tu vas les connaître tous !} \\
\textit{-Peut-être même avant !} dit Marianne avec enthousiasme. \\
\textit{-Oui ! Pourquoi pas !} \\

Ils gardèrent le silence pendant un moment puis Marianne leva timidement sa tête. \\
\textit{-Tu veux bien m'apprendre comment chercher des mots sur internet comme tu le fais ?} \\
\textit{-Bien sûr !} dit Grand Frère. \textit{Et je peux même te montrer comment le faire sur un dictionnaire, tu peux aussi t'en servir pour apprendre plus de mots.} \\
\textit{-D'accord ! Merci.} Grand Frère lui dit qu'ils feraient mieux de rentrer. \\
\textit{-Tu as un poème à écrire, après tout !}

(French) (Reading Comprehension Exercise) D G (With Answer)

Jules regardait son père avec de grands yeux pétillants pendant qu'il lui expliquait l'intérêt d'avoir de l'argent de poche avant de lui donner ce qu'il considérait être une petite somme. \\
Mais, pour le petit garçon qui n'avait jamais tenu autant d'argent, c'était une vraie fortune. \\
\textit{-Je suis riche…} murmura-t-il. \\
\textit{-Et bien…} Son père n'avait pas le cœur de le contredire et se suffit de lui sourire. \\
\textit{-Je vais pouvoir acheter tant de choses ! Vite, Papa, prends une feuille et fais une liste de tout ce que je te dis !} Jules tira son père par la manche et lui demanda de s'asseoir sur sa chaise de bureau. \\
Papa céda à sa demande et prit un stylo et une feuille blanche. \\
\textit{-Je t'écoute.} lui dit-il. \\
\textit{-Euh, d'accord, alors… la première chose que je veux acheter est une petite voiture téléguidée.} Papa prit note et retourna son regard vers Jules. \\
\textit{-Je vais aussi acheter une machine à glace, un nouveau vélo, des jeux vidéo et un ballon de football.} Jules attendit que son père finisse de noter tout ça puis énuméra un tas d'autres choses. \\
Au bout d'une demi-heure, Papa avait deux feuilles remplies d'objets que son fils voulait s'acheter avec son argent de poche. \\
Il sourit avec amusement et se demanda comment il allait dire à son petit garçon que l'argent qu'il lui avait donné n'allait pas lui suffire pour s'acheter toutes ces choses. \\
Il regarda Jules courir au meuble à chaussures et mettre ses petites baskets. \\
\textit{-Allez, viens mettre tes chaussures !} Il lui dit avec impatience. \textit{Tu dois me conduire au centre commercial pour que je puisse acheter mes affaires.} \\
\textit{-Pas encore.} dit Papa. \\
Jules fronça les sourcils, mécontent. \\
\textit{-Pourquoi pas ?} \\
\textit{-Viens là, mon chéri.} Papa lui demanda en tapotant ses genoux et Jules courut s'y installer. \\
\textit{-Je sais que tu es excité et content de recevoir ta première allocation d'argent de poche, mais je dois te dire que l'argent que tu as ne va pas te suffire pour acheter tout ce que nous avons noté. En fait, il ne te suffira même pas pour acheter quoi que ce soit dans ta liste prestigieuse.} \\

Déçu, Jules baissa la tête et bouda. Comment pouvait-papa lui dire une chose pareille ?! Et pourquoi ne l'avait-il pas dit avant ? \\
\textit{-Regarde-moi.} Papa demanda doucement. \\
\textit{-Tu ne peux pas acheter quelque chose de cher avec, mais tu peux en économiser une partie et au bout de quelques mois tu vas pouvoir t'acheter une des choses dans ta liste. La voiture, par exemple.} \\
\textit{-Une partie ?} Jules le regarda avec confusion. \\
\textit{-Tu ne crois pas qu'il serait mieux pour moi d'économiser tout mon argent de poche ?} \\
Papa hocha la tête. \\
\textit{-Tu peux le faire mais… ne voudrais-tu pas en dépenser une partie ? T'acheter des bonbons pour toi et tes amis ? Il est bien d'avoir plein de jouets mais au bout d'un moment tu vas t'en lasser et vouloir sortir jouer avec tes copains dehors.} \\

Jules y pensa un petit moment, puis dit à son père qu'il ne voulait pas le faire. \\
\textit{-Maman dit toujours que les bonbons causent des caries de toute façon. Je ne veux pas que mes dents tombent ni ceux de mes amis.} \\
Papa soupira, secoua la tête avec amusement, puis lui dit : \\
\textit{-D'accord, c'est comme tu veux.} Il lui offrit par la suite une petite tirelire en forme de tortue et lui expliqua qu'elle lui servirait à garder son argent. \\
\textit{-Mais sache qu'une fois que tu y mets de l'argent, tu ne peux plus le reprendre parce qu'il n'y a pas moyen de l'ouvrir.} \\
\textit{-Comment je vais faire lorsque j'en ai assez pour acheter ma voiture alors ?} \\
\textit{-Eh bien, tu vas la briser !} \\

Jules regarda son père avec de grands yeux surpris. \\
\textit{-Tu veux que je brise la tortue ?} \\
Papa rigola un peu et l'assura que c'est ainsi que la plupart des tirelires marchent. \\
\textit{-La prochaine fois je t'offrirai une avec un cadenas, comme ça tu vas pouvoir la garder.} lui promit-il. \\

Après quelques jours, lorsqu'il jouait avec ses deux meilleurs amis, Jules vit un camion de glace se garer près d'eux. \\
Ses deux copains sortirent leur argent et achetèrent des cornets qu'ils partagèrent avec lui. \\
Il se sentit un peu coupable de ne pas avoir voulu garder une partie de son argent pour leur rendre la pareille et le dit à son père. \\
\textit{-Eh bien, on ne peut pas retirer de l'argent de ta tirelire mais je peux te donner une petite avance sur ton allocation du mois prochain.} \\
\textit{-Vraiment ?} \\
\textit{-Oui, mais tu dois d'abord prouver que tu le mérites. Tu dois gagner ton argent.} \\

\textit{-Qu'est-ce que je dois faire ?} le petit garçon demanda. \\
\textit{-Sois un bon petit garçon, aide Maman en rangeant ta chambre et fais tes devoirs. Ne fais pas de bêtises et ne te dispute pas avec tes camarades de garderie et puis c'est tout !} Papa dit avec un sourire encourageant. \\
\textit{-D'accord.} dit Jules. \textit{Et quand est-ce que je peux avoir l'argent ?} \\
\textit{-Dans trois jours.} \\
\textit{-Marché conclu !} Papa rigola et surveilla son fils pendant les jours qui suivirent. \\

Il était content de voir Jules apprendre à être responsable avec son argent et à devenir plus généreux. \\
Lorsque trois mois s'écoulèrent, il décida de lui donner une augmentation. \\
\textit{-Pourquoi ?} demanda Jules. \\
\textit{-Parce que tu l'as mérité. Tu as été gentil avec ton institutrice et tes camarades et tu as gardé ta chambre bien propre et tu m'aides moi et Maman en donnant des bains au chien et en arrosant les plantes du jardin. Tu as fait du bon travail et c'est ta récompense.} \\

Content, Jules remercia son père et acheta une tablette de chocolat qu'il partagea avec ses parents. \\
Il avait réalisé qu'il ne devait pas être riche pour partager des choses avec ses amis et sa famille et que cela le rendait plus heureux que toutes les voitures téléguidées au monde.

(French) (Reading Comprehension Exercise) D G (With Answer)

Un matin chaud en été vit deux enfants assis devant la télévision, regardant l'écran, épatés par une artiste martiale qui démontrait quelques mouvements sophistiqués. \\
\textit{-Woah... !} Beth exclama et dut se rappeler de ne pas cligner des yeux pour ne rien rater. \\
\textit{-C'est tellement cool !} son cousin dit. Il regardait l'émission avec elle dès le début et parut aussi impressionné qu'elle l'était, avec les yeux grands ouverts et de petits souffles à chaque fois qu'un mouvement était démontré. \\
\textit{-Oui !} agrée Beth avec enthousiasme avant que les deux ne se turent de nouveau pour se concentrer sur l'émission. \\
Les deux restèrent ainsi jusqu'à la fin de l'émission et ne se levèrent que lorsqu'ils furent appelés pour descendre prendre leur déjeuner. \\
\textit{-Je veux devenir une artiste martiale quand je serai grande !} la petite fille dit en sautant les marches de l'escalier. \\
\textit{-Pas moi !} dit son cousin en courant derrière elle avec maladresse. \\
Ses mots la firent froncer les yeux en confusion. N'était-il pas aussi impressionné qu'elle, tout à l'heure ? Comment pouvait-il dire ça ? \\
\textit{-Pourquoi pas ?} demanda-t-elle sur un ton qui reflétait autant de surprise qu'elle avait ressentie. \\
\textit{-J'ai entendu dire que les artistes martiaux doivent s'entraîner très dur. J'ai aussi entendu dire qu'ils doivent casser leurs os et se déchirer les muscles pour devenir aussi forts qu'ils le sont,} répondit-il. \\
\textit{-Tu n'es pas sérieux !} exclama-t-elle. C'était horrible ! Qui peut bien subir une telle torture ? Beth frémit en pensant au fait de subir cette douleur pour devenir un bon artiste martial et elle pensa qu'elle devrait peut-être y repenser. \\

Mais elle continua à penser à l'émission qu'elle avait regardée tout à l'heure et à quel point la dame était cool quand elle donnait des coups de poing et des coups de pied aux planches en bois. \\
Elle voulait vraiment être comme elle. Peut-être qu'elle pourrait prendre des médicaments qui l'aideraient à supporter la douleur quand elle commencerait à s'entraîner ? \\
Elle regarda son cousin et plissa les yeux. Peut-être que Bobby avait tort à propos de ce qu'il lui avait dit tout à l'heure... Et puis, d'où il savait, lui ? \\
Elle devait poser la question à quelqu'un de confiance et elle savait exactement à qui s'adresser ! \\

Plus tard dans la journée, quand son cousin fit sa sieste, elle descendit parler à son grand frère qui était chargé de rester avec eux pendant que leurs parents étaient absents pour la journée. \\
\textit{-Coucou, Keith !} elle le salua avec bonne humeur. Son grand frère était la personne la plus intelligente qu'elle connaissait. Plus intelligent que ses parents, même ! \\
Il répondait toujours à ses questions et même quand il ne connaissait pas la réponse, il la cherchait pour elle. \\
\textit{-Coucou, sœurette !} répondit-il avec un sourire en fermant le livre qu'il était en train de lire. \\
\textit{-Que puis-je faire pour toi ?} dit-il en lui pinçant le nez avec un sourire taquin. \\
Beth rigola et s'assit à côté de lui sur le canapé. \\
\textit{-J'ai une question pour toi.} Elle commença. Quand son frère hocha la tête, elle continua. \\
\textit{-Est-ce qu'il est vrai que les artistes martiaux doivent se briser les os et se déchirer les muscles quand ils s'entraînent pour devenir plus forts ?} \\

Les yeux de son grand frère devinrent plus larges et il prit un moment avant de lui répondre. \\
\textit{-Je suis sûr que ce n'est pas le cas. Qui te l'a dit ?} \\
\textit{-Bobby.} \\
\textit{-Eh bien, comme je te l'ai dit, je ne crois pas que c'est vrai, mais regardons sur internet juste pour être certains.} \\

Beth regarda Keith sortir son téléphone de sa poche et taper dessus avant de lire ce qui était écrit sur l'écran pendant quelques instants. \\
\textit{-Bon, c'est un peu correct, en quelque sorte.} Beth laissa échapper un souffle d'horreur, le poussant à lever une main pour la calmer. \\
\textit{-Mais, ce n'est pas aussi douloureux que ce qu'on croit.} \\

Beth parut un peu soulagée par ces mots. \\
\textit{-Eh bien, c'est comment alors ?} demanda-t-elle avec curiosité. \\
Si ce n'était pas de la torture comme elle le croyait, alors elle avait encore une chance pour devenir une artiste martiale dans le futur. \\
Elle était une fille costaud et elle pourrait supporter un peu de douleur ! L'autre jour, elle était tombée et s'était blessée au genou, mais elle n'avait même pas pleuré ! \\

Keith sourit et lui ébouriffa les cheveux. Il tint son téléphone en face d'elle et pointa l'écran du doigt. \\
\textit{-D'après cet article, quand les gens s'entraînent pour un sport qui nécessite de frapper quelque chose ou quelqu'un, ils doivent donner des coups avec leurs mains, pieds, genoux et tout.} Il expliqua. \\
\textit{Et des fois, ils cassent des planches en bois et des trucs du genre. Pour faire ça, ils doivent frapper à grande vitesse ou bien ils doivent être très forts. Idéalement, l'artiste martial utilise une combinaison de force et de vitesse.} \\

\textit{Pour devenir aussi forts, ils doivent s'entraîner en soulevant des poids et en faisant des exercices comme des pompes et en frappant des sacs de boxe, et c'est ce qui cause les fissures dans leurs os et leurs muscles.} \\
\textit{Mais ces fissures ne sont pas dangereuses.} l'assura-t-il avec un sourire. \\
\textit{Ce sont juste de toutes petites fissures dans leurs os et quand elles guérissent, l'os devient plus dur et plus fort dans ces endroits.} conclut-il. \\

\textit{-Ohh... ! C'est logique,} Beth dit en hochant lentement la tête. \\
\textit{-C'est la même chose pour les muscles, et ça n'arrive pas qu'aux artistes martiaux. Des gens comme ceux qui font du bodybuilding soulèvent des poids lourds et ça cause des petites fissures dans leurs muscles à cause de la charge. Quand le muscle guérit et se reconstruit, il devient plus grand et plus fort. C'est pour ça que certains artistes martiaux peuvent briser des briques avec leurs mains, parce qu'ils sont assez forts mais aussi parce qu'ils sont assez rapides quand ils les frappent.} \\

\textit{-Alors, ça ne fait pas mal du tout ?} la petite fille demanda. Elle voulait s'assurer avant de prendre sa décision. \\
\textit{-Eh bien, je suis sûr que ce genre d'entraînement peut leur donner des courbatures et leur faire un peu mal, mais ce n'est rien de dangereux et s'ils le font correctement, ils ne risquent pas de se blesser,} répondit-il. \\
\textit{Le mystère est résolu ! Es-tu satisfaite, jeune demoiselle ?} \\

Beth sourit et hocha la tête. \\
\textit{-Oui ! Maintenant que tout est clair, je veux devenir une artiste martiale !} annonça-t-elle avec fierté. \\
\textit{-Oh ? Sais-tu quel art martial tu veux pratiquer ? Le Karaté ? Le Judo ? Le Hapkido ?} demanda-t-il. \\
\textit{-Euh... je ne sais pas... encore.} \\
Keith rigola et lui dit qu'elle pouvait demander à leurs parents quand ils rentreraient. \\
\textit{-Peut-être qu'ils t'emmèneront à quelques écoles d'arts martiaux et tu pourras choisir après avoir observé les autres !}

(French) (Reading Comprehension Exercise) D G (With Answer)

Cindy était assise sur les marches qui étaient à l'entrée de sa maison, elle avait la tête inclinée sur sa main et ses sourcils étaient froncés. \\
Elle scrutait l'herbe du jardin de sa maison comme si celui-ci était la source de tous ses malheurs. \\
Elle était très irritée et ceci était clair à toute personne qui l'aurait vue à ce moment-là. Ou plutôt, qui aurait vu ses expressions. \\

La raison pour laquelle Cindy faisait la tête était assez simple : elle était frustrée car elle avait eu une très bonne idée — ou, du moins, elle avait cru que c'était le cas — qui avait mal tourné quand elle avait essayé de l'exécuter. \\
Son idée n'était pas quelque chose de vraiment compliqué. C'était même une idée très simple. \\
Elle avait pensé que si elle nouait ses lacets et courait à travers son jardin, elle pourrait s'entraîner seule pour la course à trois jambes de son école. \\
Malheureusement, son idée échoua et quand elle tenta de prendre le premier pas, elle finit par tomber. \\
Ses coudes étaient égratignés et sa fierté était touchée par l'échec de l'idée qu'elle avait cru être brillante. \\
Quelle honte ! \\

\textit{-Ça aurait été super si les idées pouvaient nous prévenir d'avance et nous dire si elles sont de bonnes ou de mauvaises idées...} murmura-t-elle à elle-même avec un soupir malheureux. \\
Selon elle, cela l'aurait épargnée. Ou du moins, ses coudes auraient été épargnés. \\

Elle commença à rêvasser en pensant à cette idée. \\
\textit{-Si ma mauvaise idée était devenue une personne pour me prévenir en avance, elle aurait eu une apparence affreuse...} dit-elle en imaginant une petite version d'elle-même habillée en pyjama sale. \\
La "mauvaise" idée avait les cheveux en l'air et du sable dans les yeux, n'ayant clairement pas fait sa toilette du matin. \\

\textit{-Je parie que tu ne t'es même pas brossée les dents...} Cindy lui dit. \\
\textit{-Pourquoi faire ? Je ne vais rien accomplir de toute façon.} La petite idée-Cindy répondit en baillant. \\
\textit{-Beurk ! J'avais raison, tu as une haleine de chacal !} Cindy l'accusa en agitant sa main devant son nez. \\

L'idée sourit et agita la main avec audace avant de disparaître. \\
\textit{-Ce n'est pas étonnant qu'elle ait échoué,} pensa-t-elle. \textit{J'aurais pu deviner si j'avais vu à quoi elle ressemblait...} \\

Avec un soupir, elle décida de se dégourdir les jambes et se leva pour le faire. \\
En descendant les marches, elle pensa à la première personne qui avait pensé à les construire. \\
Elle ne connaissait pas qui avait inventé les marches et donc elle imagina que c'était elle, et une petite vision d'elle apparut devant elle. \\

\textit{-Salut, petite moi !} salua-t-elle. \\
La petite idée avait une belle apparence. Elle était habillée convenablement mais ses vêtements n'étaient pas très sophistiqués, c'était seulement une salopette en jean avec un T-shirt en coton en dessous. \\
Elle était propre et ses cheveux étaient brossés et tenus en queue de cheval. \\
Elle sourit timidement et fit un signe de la main en guise de salut. \\

\textit{-La conception des marches était une idée simple mais très bonne. Cela a permis aux gens de monter à de hauts endroits après qu'ils avaient eu des difficultés avec les pentes raides,} l'idée l'informa avec un sourire confiant. \\
Cindy hocha la tête. \\
\textit{-C'était sûrement une bonne idée vu qu'on l'utilise jusqu'à ce jour.} \\

Une autre idée apparut devant elle et s'éclaircit la gorge. \\
\textit{-L'ascenseur était une idée encore meilleure,} dit-elle avec une expression hautaine. \\
Celle-ci était habillée en costume parfaitement repassé et portait des lunettes. \\
Ses cheveux étaient coiffés en un chignon qui rappela à Cindy la directrice de son école. \\
\textit{-Très pratique pour les gens avec des handicaps et permet de gagner du temps. D'ailleurs, les gens n'ont qu'à appuyer sur quelques boutons,} l'idée ajouta. \\

Avant que Cindy n'eût le temps de répondre, l'idée-escalier prit la parole. \\
\textit{-Oui, m-mais inutile sans électricité,} elle argumenta en levant son index. \\
L'idée-ascenseur laissa échapper un souffle et parut très offensée. \\
\textit{-De nos jours, les coupures de courant sont très rares,} répondit-elle en croisant les bras. \\

\textit{-Pas aussi rares que ça dans certains pays. Je suis sûre qu'ils sont contents d'avoir des escaliers.} Telle était la réponse de l'idée-escalier. \\
Cindy rigola en regardant les deux idées se chamailler sur laquelle d'entre elles était la plus révolutionnaire jusqu'à ce que les deux disparurent avec un son de "pouf" en laissant un nuage de poussière colorée derrière elles. \\

Elle continua à marcher sans destination en tête à travers le jardin et s'arrêta quand elle vit un nain de jardin. \\
Cindy inclina la tête sur le côté et le regarda avec confusion. \\
C'était l'une des idées dont elle ne pouvait pas se résigner. À quoi pensait la personne qui les avait inventés ? \\

Soudain, une autre idée apparut devant elle. Celle-là portait une jupe, un tricot en laine et une paire de mocassins. \\
Ses cheveux étaient en cascade et elle regarda autour d'elle, distraite par son entourage. \\
\textit{-Salut...?} Cindy la salua avec hésitation. \\
\textit{-Es-tu censée être une bonne ou mauvaise idée ?} \\

L'idée haussa ses épaules et sourit. \\
\textit{-Je suis l'idée-naine-de-jardin. Je n'étais qu'une pensée impulsive, rien de trop sophistiqué.} \\
\textit{-Eh bien, comment celui qui t'a inventée a su que tu allais devenir populaire ?} Cindy demanda. \\

L'idée sourit et secoua la tête. \\
\textit{-Il ne le savait pas. Il m'a juste appliquée en espérant avoir un bon résultat. Certaines choses dans la vie marchent ainsi, le sais-tu ? Tu dois tenter ta chance et voir ce qui va se passer !} \\

Cindy regarda l'idée en face. Elle n'y avait pas pensé ainsi. \\
Elle pensa que cette approche allait lui éviter des déceptions. \\
Si quelqu'un essaie quelque chose sans penser à sa réussite ou son échec, il ne serait pas déçu en cas d'échec. \\
D'autre part, si l'idée réussit, il aurait une bonne surprise. \\

\textit{-Eh bien, je dois y aller ! À plus tard !} l'idée-naine-de-jardin dit avant de disparaître. \\
Cindy scruta l'endroit où l'idée était avant qu'un sourire n'apparût lentement sur son visage. \\
\textit{-Je crois qu'il est temps de réfléchir à quelques idées...} se dit-elle en courant à sa chambre pour commencer à planifier sa prochaine idée.

(French) (Reading Comprehension Exercise) D G (With Answer)

En un jour chaud et ensoleillé, tandis que les criquets chantaient et que les fourmis montaient en queue sur un arbre, Jacob était à quatre pattes dans le petit jardin de sa maison et cherchait sans relâche dans l'herbe en quête du trèfle à quatre feuilles légendaire. \\
Le but principal de sa recherche était de s'attribuer la chance qui venait de l'objet, comme tout le monde. \\
Il ne croyait pas qu'il allait trouver facilement un fer à cheval dans la ville et il ne voulait certainement pas avoir la patte d'un lapin ! Quel genre de personne sans cœur pourrait faire ça à un pauvre lapin ?! \\
Et donc, sa seule option était un trèfle à quatre feuilles. S'il arrivait à l'avoir, il aurait de la chance et s'il avait de la chance, tout irait à merveille dans sa vie. \\

Le seul problème était que, malgré sa recherche méticuleuse, il n'arrivait pas à trouver l'objet en question. \\
Il commençait à se sentir frustré après une demi-heure de recherche et il considérait sérieusement d'abandonner sa tâche. \\
\textit{-Je commence à croire qu'ils n'ont jamais existé...} murmura-t-il de manière grincheuse en se tapotant les mains pour se débarrasser de la terre avec un souffle. \\

\textit{-Qu'est-ce qui te fait marmonner comme ça, petit ?} La voix de sa grande sœur survint de derrière lui, le faisant sursauter. \\
\textit{-Leah ! Ne viens pas derrière les gens ainsi !} la gronda-t-il en fronçant les sourcils. \\
\textit{-Pardon,} dit-elle en rigolant avant de s'asseoir sur l'herbe à côté de lui. \\
\textit{-Alors, pourquoi es-tu si contrarié ?} demanda-t-elle en lui pinçant la joue avant qu'il ne tape sa main. \\

Il laissa échapper un souffle avec un regard misérable et se massa la tempe pour se calmer. \\
\textit{-J'ai cherché partout à travers le jardin pour trouver un trèfle à quatre feuilles mais apparemment, tous les trèfles ici n'ont que trois feuilles.} \\

\textit{-Je vois,} Leah dit en mettant un bras sur ses genoux avant de mettre son menton dessus. \\
\textit{-Et pourquoi as-tu besoin d'en trouver un à quatre feuilles ?} \\

\textit{-Pour avoir de la chance, bien sûr. Pourquoi d'autre ?} dit-il en froissant son front. \\
\textit{-Et bien, pourquoi as-tu besoin d'avoir de la chance ?} \\
Est-ce qu'elle jouait l'idiote exprès ? Il savait à quel point elle était intelligente, alors elle était sûrement en train de le taquiner. \\
Jacob n'était pas d'humeur à se faire taquiner ! \\

\textit{-Et bien pour tout ! La chance nous aide avec tout, n'est-ce pas ? Ça rend tout plus facile et meilleur ! Je serai meilleur en football et j'aurai de meilleures notes et je gagnerai chaque partie de jeux vidéo que je jouerai !} expliqua-t-il en agitant ses mains un peu partout. \\

Sa grande sœur rigola et lui ébouriffa les cheveux. \\
\textit{-Calme-toi, mon grand. Je comprends.} \\
\textit{-Alors tu vois pourquoi j'ai besoin de le trouver.} \\

\textit{-Je ne crois pas que la chance marche autant que tu le penses, tu sais ?} Leah dit. \\
Jacob souffla et roula des yeux. \\
\textit{-Ouais, c'est ça. Elle ne savait rien... Les adultes ne savaient rien sur ses problèmes.} \\

\textit{-Non, je suis sérieuse. Est-ce que tu connais quelqu'un qui a réussi dans sa vie en comptant sur la chance ?} lui demanda-t-elle en arquant ses sourcils. \\
\textit{-Et bien... non, mais...} Il prit un moment pour penser à un argument mais ne pouvait pas en avoir un. \\

\textit{-Tu vois ? La majorité des gens qui ont accompli leurs buts comptent sur autre chose. Peux-tu deviner ce que c'est ?} demanda-t-elle avec un sourire taquin. \\
\textit{-Les miracles ?} Jacob répondit avec sarcasme, la faisant rire. \\
\textit{-Non, petit malin ! Le travail. Les gens travaillent dur pour réaliser leurs rêves. Ils s'améliorent dans leur métier en travaillant dur et en s'appliquant et ils amassent de l'expérience et du savoir qui les aideraient par la suite à travailler plus rapidement et de façon meilleure,} expliqua-t-elle. \\

\textit{-Ah, bon ? Donne-moi un exemple.} Le petit garçon la défia en croisant les bras. \\
\textit{-Toi ! Tu te rappelles à quel point tu étais faible en Histoire ?} Jacob fit une grimace en pensant à ses vieilles notes en Histoire. \\
Il détestait la matière et avait refusé de la réviser. \\

Mais, il était arrivé à s'y améliorer et il avait trouvé une manière de mémoriser ses leçons de manière efficace quand il s'était décidé à le faire et avec l'aide de Leah. \\
Maintenant, l'Histoire était devenue l'une de ses matières préférées et il n'avait que de bonnes notes. \\

\textit{-D'accord. Quoi d'autre ?} demanda-t-il, pas très convaincu. \\
Leah se tourna pour regarder la maison puis autour d'elle pour s'assurer que personne d'autre que Jacob ne pouvait l'entendre. \\
\textit{-Tu te souviens à quel point Maman était mauvaise en jardinage ?} \\

Jacob rigola en pensant à toutes les pauvres plantes que sa mère avait noyées en les arrosant plus qu'il ne fallait. \\
\textit{-Elle a fait beaucoup de progrès...} dit-il en regardant les rosiers qui étaient en pleine floraison grâce aux soins de sa mère. \\

\textit{-Et tout le monde sait que j'étais très mauvaise en basketball quand je venais tout juste de commencer. Maintenant, regarde-moi ! Après des mois et des mois de travail dur, je suis devenue capitaine de mon équipe à l'école !} Leah dit avec un sourire fier. \\

\textit{-C'est vrai. Papa n'arrête pas de parler de tes exploits,} Jacob dit avec un sourire taquin. \\
\textit{-Tu vois ? En réalité, tout le monde peut devenir excellent dans n'importe quel domaine. Tu es devenu meilleur en Histoire après avoir fait des efforts. Maman est devenue meilleure en jardinage parce qu'elle a refusé d'abandonner malgré toutes les plantes qu'elle avait tuées et moi, je suis devenue meilleure en basketball après des heures et des heures d'entraînement.} \\

\textit{Toute personne qui est bonne dans un domaine était mauvaise au début et s'est seulement améliorée après s'être exercée et avoir travaillé dur. La chance est une jolie chose mais si tout le monde comptait sur elle, on n'aurait pas de progrès dans tous les domaines.} \\

Jacob hocha la tête et sourit. \\
\textit{-Je comprends. Et puis qui a besoin de chance ? Je peux tout faire tout seul.} \\

\textit{-Et si tu as des soucis, tu peux toujours demander de l'aide,} Leah lui rappela avec un sourire. \\
Jacob sourit et la regarda d'un air penaud. \\
\textit{-Alors... tu veux bien m'aider pour trouver le trèfle à quatre feuilles...? Pas pour avoir de la chance ! Juste parce que je pense que ce serait cool d'en trouver un !} \\

Leah roula les yeux au ciel avec une expression affectueuse et lui sourit avant que les deux ne recommencent à chercher le fameux objet porteur de chance.

(French) (Reading Comprehension Exercise) D G (With Answer)

\textit{-C'est trop calme ici,} Charlie dit en avançant avec prudence à travers les allées humides de la cité. Il faisait nuit, les lampadaires clignaient, tantôt allumés, tantôt éteints, et la lune était cachée par les nuages. \\
La rue était sombre et suspicieuse. \\
Il monta les escaliers de secours qui étaient sales et couverts de rouille puis, il se positionna sur le bord de la terrasse pour ensuite pouvoir regarder à travers le télescope de son fusil de tireur d'élite. \\
Il guetta les parages et garda l'œil grand ouvert pour voir s'il y avait n'importe quel signe de problème. \\

Quelques moments plus tard, les bruits perçants de tirs venant d'une arme à feu résonnèrent en bas. Il vit son partenaire courir hors d'un immeuble avant de s'abriter derrière un camion et il essaya de localiser l'ennemi. \\
Une fois qu'il repéra le tireur qui avait tiré sur son partenaire, il le cibla et l'élimina avec une seule balle sur le front. \\
\textit{"Mission accomplie. Ton équipe a gagné !"} les haut-parleurs de son casque annoncèrent, le tirant hors de l'atmosphère sérieuse du jeu. \\

\textit{-Bien joué, Chuck !} la voix de son partenaire et ami dit à travers son casque, le félicitant pour sa manœuvre talentueuse dans le jeu. \\
\textit{-Merci. Toi aussi ! Tu veux jouer une autre partie ?} Charlie demanda sur un ton excité. \\
\textit{-Je ne peux pas. Ma mère m'appelle pour le déjeuner. Peut-être plus tard !} \\
\textit{-D'accord. À plus tard, alors !} Charlie dit avant de se déconnecter. \\

Il ouvrit un autre jeu et était sur le point de lancer une partie quand sa mère l'appela pour descendre prendre son déjeuner. \\
Il soupira, déçu d'attendre jusqu'à plus tard pour jouer davantage et enleva son casque pour le poser sur son bureau avant de mettre son ordinateur en veille. \\

En sortant de sa chambre, il vit sa petite sœur descendre les escaliers pour aller à la cuisine pour le déjeuner et il perdit soudain tout contact avec la réalité et commença à voir son entourage comme un environnement de jeu. \\
Charlie avança à travers le couloir sans faire de bruit, il se cacha derrière des meubles et des chaises avant de descendre silencieusement les escaliers. \\

Une fois derrière sa petite sœur, il lui donna un petit coup sur la tête avec son index qui était pointé comme un pistolet. \\
\textit{-Pam ! Je t'ai eu !} dit-il. \\
\textit{-Arrête, tu es méchant !} sa petite sœur lui dit en se tournant pour lui taper la main. \\
\textit{-Tu n'es qu'une pleurnicheuse, Trixie !} dit-il. \textit{-Je vais arriver avant toi au quartier général !} \\

Et sur ce, il la poussa à côté et courut à la cuisine. Sa petite sœur roula les yeux au plafond à cause de son comportement et marcha calmement vers la cuisine. \\
\textit{-Maman, Charlie est en train de faire l'idiot encore une fois !} elle se plaignit avant de s'asseoir. \\
\textit{-Trix, qu'est-ce qu'on a dit à propos d'insulter ton frère ?} sa mère la réprimanda. \\
\textit{-Désolée...} la petite fille s'excusa avant de tirer la langue à Charlie qui était en train de lui sourire avec un air taquin. \\

\textit{-Merci d'avoir soutenu mon clan, grand maître.} Charlie dit à sa mère. \\
\textit{-Et merci pour ce festin.} Sa mère laissa échapper un rire et secoua la tête en le regardant. \\
\textit{-Je ne soutiens aucun clan, Charles. Tu ne dois pas embêter ta sœur,} dit-elle sur un ton strict mais pas cruel. \\

Charlie fit une grimace en entendant son prénom. \\
\textit{-Je ne l'embêtais pas ! Je jouais seulement avec elle ! Comme ça, regarde !} \\

Il prit une olive du plat de condiments, la mit sur sa cuillère puis plia la cuillère de façon à pouvoir tirer l'olive sur Trixie lorsqu'il la lâcherait. \\
\textit{-Charles, n'ose même pas y penser !} sa mère le prévint. \\
Le garçon soupira et posa la cuillère et l'olive. \\

\textit{-Personne n'apprécie mon talent...} Sa mère laissa échapper un soupir et décida qu'il était temps d'avoir une discussion sérieuse avec le garçon. \\
\textit{-Charlie, mon chou, tu dois cesser d'agir comme si tout était un jeu. Ton enseignant m'a appelé l'autre jour et m'a dit que tu t'es bagarré avec ton camarade et que tu as refusé de t'excuser.} \\

\textit{-Ça, c'était différent !} \\

\textit{-Quand tu lui as demandé pourquoi tu devais t'excuser et qu'il t'a dit que c'était parce que tu l'avais vexé, qu'avais-tu répondu ?} \\
\textit{-Je lui ai demandé comment il pouvait le savoir alors qu'il ne pouvait même pas lire ses données...} murmura-t-il en évitant de regarder sa mère dans les yeux. \\

\textit{-Oui, et je crois que tu sais bien que les gens ne peuvent pas... visualiser les données des autres, n'est-ce pas ?} \\
\textit{-Oui, Maman.} \\

\textit{-Et tu sais que tu ne dois pas jeter des olives sur ta sœur, pas vrai ?} \\
\textit{-Oui.} \\

\textit{-Et tu dois arrêter de dire que la maison du voisin est un "territoire ennemi", c'est offensant.} \\
\textit{-Mais leur chien ne cesse pas d'aboyer quand Trix et moi allons à l'école le matin !} il répondit en sa défense. \\

\textit{-Charlie,} sa mère dit pour le mettre en garde. \\
\textit{-D'accord, je ne vais plus dire ça...} \\

\textit{-Mon chéri, je ne veux pas te rendre triste. Mais si tu continues à agir comme ça, tu vas avoir des ennuis,} sa mère dit en caressant sa joue affectueusement. \\
\textit{Je m'inquiète pour toi, Charlie.} \\

Il se sentit coupable d'avoir inquiété sa mère et lui sourit d'un air penaud. \\
\textit{-Je suis désolé, maman. Parfois, je me laisse aller, mais je te promets que je vais essayer de mieux me comporter dorénavant.} \\

\textit{-Tant mieux, parce que sinon Maman et Papa vont confisquer tes jeux !} sa petite sœur menaça. \\
\textit{-Ils ne peuvent pas confisquer des jeux en ligne, petit génie !} \\

\textit{-Et bien, alors ils vont confisquer ton ordinateur !} \\
\textit{-Allons, allons les enfants. Du moment que tout le monde se comporte sagement, rien ne va être confisqué et Charlie a promis de rester sage,} leur mère dit. \\
\textit{-Par contre, ceux qui ne finiront pas leurs assiettes ne vont pas avoir de dessert.} \\

Les deux enfants échangèrent un regard avant de tourner leur attention sur leurs assiettes et ils continuèrent de manger avec enthousiasme.

(French) (Reading Comprehension Exercise) D G (With Answer)

Un après-midi nuageux, alors que la brise soufflait doucement pour apporter un peu de fraîcheur, un vieil homme et sa petite-fille entrèrent dans une boutique de bibelots au bord de la mer. \\
Tandis que le vieil homme alla parler avec le propriétaire de la boutique qui était son ami, la petite fille profita de l'occasion pour regarder autour d'elle et observer ce qu'il y avait dans la boutique comme articles. \\

Elle admira les différents petits bibelots qui paraissaient être des souvenirs ramenés de voyages à travers différents et lointains mondes. \\
Elle vit quelques carillons éoliens, tous de différentes couleurs et tailles, ce qui indiquait qu'ils étaient collectionnés à travers les années plutôt que fournis en gros depuis un stock d'usine. \\
Elle passa les doigts à travers eux et se détendit en entendant le son de leur doux tintement avant de passer à l'objet suivant qui attira son attention : les capteurs de rêves. \\

Les objets circulaires avaient des filets tissés en différents motifs et décorés avec des perles colorées ainsi que de très belles plumes qui étaient suspendues sur la partie inférieure. \\
Chaque capteur de rêves paraissait unique et différent des autres. \\
Après qu'elle les eut admirés assez longtemps, elle se tourna vers les jolies poupées russes qui étaient mises en valeur sur une étagère qui leur avait été dédiée. \\

Elle rigola en voyant à quel point les poupées rondes étaient mignonnes et sourit avec affection en admirant leurs couleurs. \\
En dessous, il y avait des œufs de joaillier, émaillés d'or et d'argent et incrustés de pierres précieuses qui brillaient dans la faible lueur. \\
Ils avaient l'air très chers et elle se demanda ce qu'ils faisaient dans une boutique de bibelots au lieu d'être dans une bijouterie. \\

Cependant, ce qui attira le plus l'attention de la petite fille étaient les bateaux en bouteilles qui étaient dans un coin de la boutique. \\
Ils étaient sur un présentoir de façon à ce que chaque bateau soit sur une étagère. \\
Certains étaient plus larges que les autres mais ils inspiraient tous la même émotion : l'émerveillement. \\

\textit{-As-tu trouvé quelque chose qui t'a plu, Aria ?} son grand-père dit de l'autre côté du magasin où le comptoir se situait. \\
\textit{-Je suis juste en train d'observer !} répondit-elle sans détourner son regard des bateaux en bouteilles. \\
\textit{-Mais, comment... ?} murmura-t-elle. \textit{Comment étaient-ils faits ?} Était-ce ce qu'elle se demandait. \\
Comment est-ce que les gens étaient arrivés à faire rentrer des bateaux de cette taille dans des bouteilles à travers leurs petites ouvertures ? \\

Le propriétaire du magasin et son grand-père se rendirent où elle se tenait et tandis que son grand-père serra un bras autour de ses épaules, l'autre homme prit l'une des bouteilles. \\
\textit{-Tu te demandes comment ils sont faits, n'est-ce pas ?} il questionna avec un doux regard. \\
\textit{-Oui ! Comment avez-vous su ?} Le vieil homme rigola et lui tapota la tête tendrement. \\

\textit{-Tout le monde se pose cette question quand ils les voient,} dit-il en lui passant la bouteille. \\

Aria tendit ses mains et lui prit le bateau. Elle le tint au niveau de ses yeux et plissa ceux-ci pour voir tous les détails du bateau. \\
Il était fait en bois et les voiles semblaient être faites en papier. Tout avait l'air réel, du nom peint sur le côté du bateau au nid de pie sur le point le plus haut. \\

\textit{-Alors... vous savez comment ça a été fait ?} demanda-t-elle curieusement au propriétaire de la boutique en lui repassant le précieux objet. \\
Le vieil homme hocha la tête et se tourna vers elle après avoir remis la bouteille à sa place. \\

\textit{-Certains croient qu'il y a longtemps de cela, quand les marins oubliaient leurs bouteilles ouvertes avant de s'endormir, de toutes petites créatures sortaient de leurs cachettes et construisaient des bateaux qui flottaient sur le liquide qui était dans la bouteille.} \\
\textit{Quand le liquide séchait au lever du jour, les créatures disparaissaient après avoir fini leur tâche et seul le bateau restait dans la bouteille, la rendant inutilisable.} \\

\textit{Les marins n'avaient pas d'autres choix que de garder les bateaux en bouteilles pour décorer ou les vendre aux touristes.} \\

Émerveillée par la légende, Aria ne dit rien à travers le récit du vieux vendeur. \\

\textit{-Cependant,} le vieil homme reprit la parole. \\
\textit{-Les humains commencèrent à copier le travail des minuscules êtres et commencèrent à créer ces modèles eux-mêmes.} \\

\textit{D'ailleurs,} dit-il en regardant son grand-père. \\
\textit{-Ton vieillard sait comment les fabriquer. Tous ces modèles ont été faits par ton grand-père !} \\

Aria laissa échapper un souffle et tourna la tête pour faire face à son grand-père. \\
\textit{-Vraiment ?} murmura-t-elle. \\

Grand-père rigola et la serra contre lui. \\
\textit{-En effet. On peut en faire un quand on rentre à la maison si tu veux,} lui dit-il. \\
\textit{-Oui, s'il te plaît !} dit-elle avec grand enthousiasme. \\

Tenant sa parole, lorsqu'ils retournèrent chez lui, grand-père ramena du bois, du papier, de la colle et d'autres matériaux dont ils avaient besoin pour faire le modèle. \\
\textit{-Tout d'abord, on va construire la base du bateau,} son grand-père lui dit en prenant un morceau de bois et en commençant à le sculpter avant de le peindre en marron foncé. \\

\textit{-Puis, on commence par le glisser à l'intérieur de la bouteille. On va monter les différentes pièces du bateau à l'intérieur de la bouteille.} \\
Il fit cela avant de demander à sa petite fille de dessiner des formes de voiles sur le papier. \\

\textit{-Maintenant, coupe-les pendant que je noue le fil qui va servir de cordes à la base du bateau.} \\

Les deux travaillèrent en silence, chacun plongé dans sa tâche et quand il était temps pour la touche finale, grand-père utilisa deux longs crochets en métal pour tirer les fils qui étaient noués aux voiles et en tirant rapidement sur eux, les voiles s'étendirent et l'œuvre fut terminée. \\

\textit{-Juste un dernier petit détail,} dit-il en lui passant le bouchon en liège. \\
\textit{-Tu veux bien ?} \\

\textit{-Avec plaisir !} Aria prit la pièce en bois dans sa main et l'inséra dans l'ouverture de la bouteille en verre. \\
\textit{-Voilà. C'est fini !}

(French) (Reading Comprehension Exercise) D G (With Answer)

C'était calme et silencieux chez les Walter, mis à part les sons de claquement de fourchettes contre les plats. \\
Toute la famille était réunie pour savourer leur déjeuner ensemble et bien qu'ils parlèrent à certains moments, ils étaient principalement concentrés sur leurs assiettes. \\

Jayden, le membre le plus jeune de la famille, prit un morceau de carotte avec sa fourchette et le regarda curieusement. \\
Ça n'avait pas un mauvais goût et il n'avait jamais eu de problèmes pour manger ses légumes mais il ne les trouvait pas aussi bons que du chocolat ou des bonbons. \\

\textit{-Est-ce qu'il y a un problème avec ta nourriture, mon grand ?} demanda son père qui avait préparé le déjeuner ce jour-là en le voyant regarder le morceau de carotte. \\
\textit{-Non. Tout est bon,} Jayden dit en mettant le morceau de légume dans sa bouche. \\

\textit{-Pourquoi regardais-tu tes carottes comme ça, alors ?} demanda sa mère. \\
Le petit garçon haussa ses épaules avec nonchalance. \\
\textit{-C'est juste que je ne comprends pas.} Sa réponse vague n'éclaircit rien pour ses parents et son père lui demanda ce qu'il ne comprenait pas exactement. \\

Jayden finit de mâcher sa nourriture avant de répondre. \\
\textit{-Eh bien, pourquoi devons-nous manger des légumes et de la viande et des pâtes et tout quand on peut manger des trucs bons au lieu de ça ?} \\

\textit{-Tu ne trouves pas que les pâtes sont bonnes ? J'ai cru que tu aimais les spaghetti aux boulettes de viande,} son père lui dit. \\
\textit{Tu avais dit que c'était bon la dernière fois que nous en avons mangé.} \\
\textit{-Ouais, ce n'est pas mal, je crois...} Il soupira avant de prendre un peu de brocoli de son assiette et de le manger. \\

Ses parents se regardèrent avant que sa mère ne lui demande ce qu'il voulait dire par des trucs bons. \\
\textit{-Eh bien, tu sais...} Il posa sa fourchette et regarda ses parents. \\
\textit{Des barres de chocolat et des sucettes et des bonbons. Des trucs bons comme ça. Pourquoi ne pouvons-nous pas en manger à chaque repas ? On n'en mange qu'en tant que gâteries et lors des fêtes.} \\

\textit{-Eh bien, c'est parce qu'ils ne sont pas très nutritifs,} son père lui dit. \\

Jayden ne savait pas ce que “nutritifs” voulait dire et fixa son père du regard. \\
Celui-ci reçut le message et commença à expliquer en termes plus simples. \\
\textit{-Tu n'auras pas de vitamines ni de protéines en mangeant des bonbons. Ce n'est en réalité que du sucre... et il y a aussi du gras dans le chocolat et quelques autres sortes de bonbons.} \\

\textit{-Je croyais que le sucre nous donne de l'énergie,} Jayden dit en retour. \\
\textit{-Eh bien, c'est vrai, mais seulement en petites quantités.} \\

\textit{Et il y a aussi quelques types de sucre plus complexes qui nous donnent de l'énergie de façon meilleure et tu peux en trouver dans les pommes de terre et les pâtes.} \\

La maman de Jayden lui expliqua en montrant son assiette du doigt. \\
Il regarda la part de purée de pommes de terre qui était dans son assiette et en prit une bouchée avant de retourner son attention vers ses parents. \\

\textit{-Haylee prend ces pilules qui contiennent des vitamines à l'intérieur,} dit-il en pointant sa fourchette sur sa grande sœur. \\
\textit{Pourquoi on n'en prend pas à la place des légumes ? Comme ça on aura des vitamines et on gardera de la place dans nos ventres pour les bonbons ?} \\

\textit{-Eh bien, ces pilules s'appellent des suppléments et elles ne sont utilisées que pour t'aider.} \\
\textit{Haylee mange quand même tous ses légumes et sa nourriture, n'est-ce pas ?} sa mère répondit. \\

\textit{-Oui, je suppose...} \\

\textit{-Et les suppléments ne contiennent pas beaucoup de fibres. Les fibres sont très importantes parce qu'elles aident ton ventre à digérer ta nourriture.} \\
\textit{Si tu ne manges pas assez de fibres, tu peux avoir des maux d'estomac,} son père ajouta. \\

\textit{-Et même quand tu manges ta nourriture, tu peux quand même avoir mal au ventre en mangeant trop de bonbons et de sucreries.} \\
\textit{Tu te rappelles de la fois où tu avais mangé la moitié du gâteau d'anniversaire de Grand-mère ?} sa mère demanda en arquant son sourcil. \\

Jayden fit une grimace en se rappelant du souvenir. \\
Non seulement il avait eu terriblement mal au ventre, mais il avait dû boire un horrible sirop amer pour se remettre de son malaise. \\
\textit{Beurk ! Oui. Je m'en rappelle.} \\

\textit{-Et les bonbons te font grossir !} sa grande sœur lui dit. \\

C'était la première fois qu'elle avait parlé depuis le début de la conversation. \\
Jayden fronça ses sourcils et la regarda curieusement. \\
Comment était-il possible pour un tout petit morceau de caramel de faire grossir qui que ce soit ? \\

Il regarda son assiette qui était encore à moitié pleine. \\
Si quelque chose avait le potentiel de faire grossir les gens, ça devrait être les immenses quantités de nourriture qu'ils mangeaient à chaque repas. \\

\textit{-Je crois que les pâtes et la purée de pommes de terre peuvent te rendre encore plus gros que les bonbons...} répondit-il. \\

\textit{-Tu as besoin de glucides et tu peux en avoir en mangeant des pâtes, des pommes de terre et du pain ainsi que des aliments semblables et ton corps prend un peu de temps pour les transformer en sucre,} \\
\textit{et donc tu ne grossis pas en les mangeant sauf si tu en manges plus que tu n'es censé.} \\

\textit{Les légumes ne contiennent pas beaucoup de sucre, et la viande n'en contient pas du tout.} \\
\textit{Mais les bonbons sont purement faits en sucre et à part si tu es en train de faire des activités qui brûlent ce sucre rapidement, ton corps va le garder sous forme de gras.} \\

\textit{En y pensant, manger équilibré t'aide à rester en forme parce que tu remplis ton ventre avec des choses qui sont bonnes pour ton corps et tu te sens rassasié et du coup tu ne grignotes pas en mangeant des bonbons.} \\

Dit-elle en lui pinçant la joue joyeusement. \\
\textit{-Je comprends que les pâtes et les pommes de terre me donnent de l'énergie et que les légumes gardent mon ventre en bonne santé, mais quel est l'intérêt de la viande ?} le petit garçon demanda, sur un ton qui défia ses parents. \\

Bon, il avoua que la viande avait un bon goût en quelque sorte, mais ce n'était pas mieux que les bonbons. \\

\textit{-La viande t'aide à grandir. Les gens ayant des muscles impressionnants mangent beaucoup de viande, des poissons et des œufs pour avoir des protéines.} \\
\textit{Tout comme le lait aide tes os à devenir plus forts, la viande aide tes muscles aussi,} son père répondit en pliant son bras pour montrer son biceps à Jayden. \\

Bon, Jay devait admettre que l'idée d'avoir des muscles comme ceux de son père était vraiment cool et il voulait grandir et devenir fort comme lui. \\
Il regarda son assiette, prit sa fourchette et recommença à manger. \\

Une fois qu'il eut fini son assiette, il regarda son père et demanda : \\
\textit{-Alors, on mange quoi pour le dessert ?} \\

Tous les membres de la famille qui étaient à table secouèrent leur tête affectueusement. \\
\textit{-Une salade de fruits,} son père lui dit et l'expression déçue de Jayden fit rire tout le monde.

(French) (Reading Comprehension Exercise) D G (With Answer)

Eleanor tapota ses doigts sur son bureau en observant la progression de ses téléchargements sur l'écran de son ordinateur. \\
Elle avait trouvé de très bons jeux en ligne et elle pensait qu'elle allait pouvoir s'amuser en y jouant et passer le temps durant ses vacances d'été quand il ferait trop chaud pour sortir jouer dehors. \\
Cependant, après avoir vu les descriptions des jeux, elle devint surexcitée et voulut les essayer immédiatement. \\
Le seul problème était qu'ils prenaient trop de temps pour se télécharger et elle commença à perdre patience. \\

\textit{-Arrghhh !} elle cria avec frustration. \textit{Allez ! Plus rapidement, je vous en supplie !} \\

Sa grande sœur qui passait devant sa chambre à ce moment-là devint curieuse et frappa sur la porte ouverte de sa chambre. \\
\textit{-Est-ce que je peux entrer ?} demanda-t-elle. \\
\textit{-Bien sûr...} répondit Eleanor avec distraction. \\

\textit{-Qu'est-ce qui se passe, Elle ?} sa sœur demanda en s'asseyant sur le bord de son lit. \\
\textit{-C'est juste cette stupide connexion internet qui est trop lente ! J'attends le téléchargement de ces fichiers depuis des lustres !} La fillette répondit avec rage. \\

\textit{-Tu es en train de télécharger des fichiers ? Est-ce qu'ils proviennent d'une source sécurisée ?} sa sœur demanda en mettant une mèche de ses cheveux derrière son oreille et en se penchant en avant pour regarder l'écran de l'ordinateur. \\

Eleanor haussa ses épaules et dit qu'elle n'avait pas vérifié la source en réalité. \\
\textit{-Je ne connais même pas la différence entre une source qui est sécurisée et une autre qui ne l'est pas.} \\

\textit{-Eh bien, laisse-moi te montrer.} Sa sœur se leva et se mit derrière sa chaise avant de se pencher en avant et de prendre la souris. \\
Elle alla sur un site et utilisa le curseur de la souris pour montrer la partie supérieure du navigateur où le lien du site était écrit. \\

\textit{-Tu vois ce cadenas ? Ça veut dire que le site sur lequel tu es est sûr et vérifié. Tout ce que tu télécharges depuis ce site ne va pas faire de mal à ton ordinateur,} elle l'informa avant de lui demander d'aller sur le site depuis lequel elle avait téléchargé ses jeux. \\

\textit{-Regarde ! Il y a un cadenas vert !} La fillette dit en montrant du doigt l'icône en question. \\

Sa sœur hocha la tête avant de fermer l'onglet. \\
\textit{-Oui, ce site est aussi sécurisé. Donc, tes jeux ne sont pas dangereux.} \\

Eleanor hocha la tête, ayant compris. \\
\textit{-Qu'est-ce qui se passerait si je télécharge des trucs à partir de sites non vérifiés ?} \\

\textit{-Eh bien, ça dépend. Parfois, rien de grave. Si tu as de la chance, rien de mauvais ne se passe, mais parfois tu peux avoir des virus sur ton système.} \\

Eleanor pencha la tête curieusement sur le côté et demanda à sa sœur ce qu'était un virus et comment cela fonctionnait. \\
\textit{-J'entends toujours les gens en parler, mais je n'ai jamais compris ce qu'est vraiment un virus d'ordinateur.} \\

\textit{-Bon alors, un virus d'ordinateur est un type de logiciel malveillant.} \\
\textit{Comme d'autres logiciels de ce genre, les virus sont des programmes qui s'exécutent avec d'autres programmes.} \\

\textit{Dans notre cas, un virus pourrait s'exécuter avec l'un des jeux que tu es en train de télécharger et se copier sur ton système.} \\
\textit{Il peut exécuter des instructions dangereuses qui peuvent endommager tes fichiers et ralentir ton ordinateur.} \\

\textit{-Oh ! C'est ce qui se passe quand on attrape froid, n'est-ce pas ? Ça rentre dans nos corps et nous rend malade et alités,} la petite fille remarqua. \\

\textit{-Oui ! En fait, c'est la raison pour laquelle ce type de logiciel malveillant est nommé un virus.} \\
\textit{Car ça marche de la même manière qu'un virus de rhume ou de grippe,} sa sœur lui dit. \\

\textit{-Tu continues à répéter les mots “ce type de logiciel malveillant”, quels sont les autres types ?} Eleanor demanda en se penchant en avant dans sa chaise. \\

\textit{-Eh bien, il y a plusieurs autres types. L'un d'eux est un type qu'on appelle un cheval de Troie.} \\
\textit{Connais-tu l'histoire du cheval de Troie dans l'histoire ?} \\

Eleanor secoua la tête, indiquant que non. \\
\textit{-Bon, dans la mythologie grecque, on dit que la femme du roi de Sparte, Hélène, avait été kidnappée et emmenée à Troie.} \\
\textit{Ceci poussa le roi à demander de l'aide auprès des Grecs qui acceptèrent d'aller au secours d'Hélène.} \\

\textit{Mais, la cité de Troie était protégée par de grands murs et on ne pouvait pas y accéder facilement et donc le général Grec Ulysse pensa à jouer un tour pour s'y introduire et sauver Hélène avec ses guerriers.} \\

\textit{Et donc, les Grecs bâtirent un immense cheval en bois et le laissèrent hors du portail de Troie en guise d'offrande et l'armée fit semblant de battre en retraite.} \\

\textit{Les gens de Troie, contents de leur victoire, tirèrent le cheval à l'intérieur de la cité et le mirent au centre pour que tout le monde puisse l'admirer.} \\

\textit{La nuit, quand tout le monde dormait, quelques guerriers qui étaient cachés à l'intérieur du cheval en sortirent et ouvrirent les portails de Troie pour le reste de l'armée et à partir de là, tu peux facilement deviner qui avait gagné cette guerre.} \\

Eleanor écouta l'histoire avec fascination avant de demander quel lien ça avait avec le logiciel malveillant. \\
\textit{-Le cheval de Troie marche d'une façon semblable.} \\
\textit{Il se fait passer pour un logiciel inoffensif pour te pousser à le télécharger et l'installer et une fois sur ton système, il peut donner accès aux attaquants à tes fichiers et ils pourront t'espionner, voler tes fichiers et même télécharger plus de logiciels malveillants sur ton ordinateur.} \\

\textit{-Oh... C'est horrible !} Eleanor dit en regardant l'écran de son ordinateur. \\

Ses téléchargements étaient toujours en cours et elle retourna son attention sur sa sœur. \\
\textit{Comment pourrais-je protéger mon ordinateur des logiciels malveillants ?} \\

\textit{-Tu peux utiliser un logiciel antivirus.} \\
\textit{Ils te préviennent en général quand tu es sur le point de télécharger quelque chose de suspect et tu peux même les utiliser pour nettoyer ton ordinateur et te débarrasser des logiciels malveillants qui y sont déjà.} \\

\textit{Comme je l'ai déjà dit, évite d'aller sur des sites qui ne sont pas vérifiés et sécurisés et ne télécharge rien à partir d'une source inconnue.} \\

\textit{Et pour être sûr, s'il y a des fichiers importants sur ton ordinateur, fais-en une copie de secours et charge-la sur un drive en ligne ou sur une clé USB juste pour ne pas perdre tes données au cas où quelque chose arrive à ton système.} \\

Eleanor hocha la tête avec enthousiasme et remercia sa sœur pour ses explications. \\
\textit{-Tout est plus clair maintenant.} \\

Elle se tourna vers son ordinateur et vit que les téléchargements de ses jeux étaient terminés et elle lança leurs installations avec excitation. \\
Maintenant qu'elle était sûre qu'ils n'étaient pas dangereux pour son ordinateur, elle allait s'amuser en y jouant encore plus.

(French) (Reading Comprehension Exercise) D G (With Answer)

Le soleil baignait le monde dans sa chaleur et sa lumière éclaircissait les fleurs en éclosion. \\
Ce beau matin, une petite fille regardait le joli jardin de sa grand-mère depuis le bord de la fenêtre de sa chambre, en tenant un verre de limonade dans sa main. \\
Elle soupira joyeusement après avoir pris une bonne bouffée d'air frais qui portait les douces odeurs des plantes puis, pencha sa tête sur la fenêtre, ayant la paisible sensation d'être chez elle. \\

Soudain, un petit mouvement irrégulier saisit son attention et elle concentra son regard sur la source de ce mouvement qui était une toute petite araignée suspendue au bout d'un fil qui était emporté par la brise. \\
Felicity rigola sur la scène bizarre qui lui rappela, en fait, un film qu'elle avait regardé il n'y avait pas très longtemps avec ses grands-parents. \\

\textit{-Cette araignée paraît exactement comme les cambrioleurs qui étaient descendus du plafond pour voler le joyau du musée royal,} pensa-t-elle en regardant le petit insecte s'éloigner d'elle, flottant vers l'inconnu. \\

Elle tourna son regard vers la plante empotée qui était juste sous la fenêtre et regarda une abeille qui avait la tête dans une fleur et elle laissa échapper un rire. \\
\textit{-Quelle petite créature loufoque !} dit-elle en regardant le petit insecte volant se tortiller pour aller plus profondément dans la fleur. \\

Les abeilles travaillaient tellement dur ! La petite fille soupira et pensa que la vie devait être très intéressante pour les insectes. \\
Elle se demanda ce que ça ferait de voir les choses de leur perspective. \\

Tout devait paraître gigantesque et les petits brins d'herbe qu'elle voyait devaient être une jungle pour les minuscules insectes qui résidaient dans le jardin de sa grand-mère. \\

\textit{-Si seulement je pouvais rétrécir pour un jour...} pensa-t-elle en baillant avec paresse juste avant de s'endormir contre la fenêtre. \\

Quand elle se leva, elle était toujours sur le bord de la fenêtre dans la maison de sa grand-mère mais elle était devenue beaucoup plus petite. \\

\textit{-Fais attention à ce que tu souhaites, hein...?} elle murmura à elle-même en regardant autour d'elle avec fascination. \\
Elle ne sentit aucun regret, par contre. Elle était excitée de vivre ce nouveau changement et était impatiente de voir comment sa journée allait se dérouler. \\

Elle passa un peu de temps à observer son entourage. \\
Tout paraissait différent. Le verre de limonade - qui était à présent tiède - dont elle buvait auparavant lui sembla être aussi haut qu'une tour et le bord de la fenêtre paraissait aussi vaste qu'une autoroute. \\

Les rayons de soleil qui perçaient la vitre étaient éblouissants et dégageaient de la chaleur et elle fit en sorte de se mettre dans les endroits les moins intenses. \\
Ce qu'elle crut être une légère brise avant se transforma en un vent soufflant qui lui ébouriffa les cheveux. \\

Quand elle se tourna pour regarder sa chambre, elle ne put pas voir grand-chose au-delà de son vaste lit. \\
L'ours en peluche qui y était se tenait comme une statue immense et elle abandonna l'idée d'explorer la chambre le moment où elle l'eut en tête. \\

Elle voulait voir à quoi le monde extérieur ressemblait et elle n'était pas sûre qu'elle allait pouvoir regrimper sur le bord de la fenêtre plus tard si elle en descendait maintenant. \\
Et donc, en se tournant vers la fenêtre, elle la regarda pour voir si elle pourrait trouver le chemin le plus facile pour descendre au jardin et sa recherche fut fructueuse en peu de temps. \\

Elle marcha vers l'extrémité gauche de la fenêtre et testa les petites branches de la plante qui avaient grimpé le long des murs de la maison de ses grands-parents et quand elle était sûre qu'elles étaient assez robustes, elle les utilisa pour descendre. \\

L'odeur de l'herbe fraîchement tondue la frappa et elle marcha à travers le gazon en écartant les brins d'herbe de son chemin avec ses mains. \\
Elle regarda à sa droite et vit des fourmis marcher en file à un rythme rapide. \\
La plupart des fourmis portaient une sorte de graines qui étaient deux fois plus grandes qu'elles et elle les regarda passer avec admiration. \\

Une fois la parade de fourmis passée, elle reprit son chemin et l'insecte suivant qu'elle vit fut un mille-pattes. \\
Elle laissa échapper un souffle effrayé car l'insecte lui parut beaucoup plus intimidant quand elle était aussi petite et elle décida de ne pas bouger et de garder le silence, faisant semblant de ne pas exister jusqu'à ce que la voie devienne libre. \\

Quand l'insecte ayant plus de pattes qu'elle ne put compter passa, elle reprit son chemin autour du jardin. \\
\textit{-Wow...} murmura-t-elle, impressionnée en voyant une libellule juste avant qu'elle ne s'envole. \\
Elle était magnifique et elle se sentit chanceuse d'avoir pu la voir de si près. \\

En allant plus loin à travers le jardin, elle rencontra aussi une créature moins jolie. \\
Elle fit la grimace en dégoût alors qu'une limace passa devant elle, laissant une traînée de bave qu'elle devait croiser pour continuer en avant. \\

\textit{-Il n'y a rien à faire...} dit-elle à elle-même en mettant un pied au-delà du chemin de bave après l'autre. \\

Mais, tandis qu'elle était occupée à croiser sans mettre les pieds sur la substance dégoûtante, elle ne vit pas la mante religieuse géante qui la guettait et lorsqu'elle se tourna, elle la vit sauter sur elle. \\

Avant qu'elle n'eût le temps de crier, elle se trouva en l'air et quand elle regarda en haut, elle ne put voir que les grandes ailes colorées d'un papillon. \\
L'insecte la déposa sur le bord de la fenêtre et inclina la tête avant de s'envoler. \\

\textit{-Merci de m'avoir sauvé !} Felicity cria en agitant la main en l'air. \\
\textit{Je crois que cela me fait assez d'excitation pour aujourd'hui...} se dit-elle en glissant sur le rideau et avant de grimper sur ses draps. \\

Elle se mit sur son lit à côté de l'ours en peluche géant et décida de prendre une sieste après sa marche fatigante à travers le jardin géant. \\
Elle ferma les yeux et elle sut que lorsqu'elle les ouvrirait la prochaine fois, elle aurait regagné sa taille normale.

(French) (Reading Comprehension Exercise) D G (With Answer)


Le ciel était clair et le soleil brillait. Les oiseaux chantaient avec les criquets, ajoutant une joyeuse mélodie aux couleurs éclatantes de l'été. \\
Les joyeux cris et rires des enfants s'ajoutaient à cette symphonie tandis qu'ils jouaient au football dans le parc de leur quartier et tout était parfait jusqu'à ce que l'un d'eux trébuche et fasse une horrible chute. \\

\textit{-On arrête tout, Riley est tombé !} L'un d'eux cria, causant aux autres de s'arrêter au milieu de la partie. \\
Tout le monde se rassembla autour du petit garçon et ils lui demandèrent s'il allait bien avec inquiétude. \\

\textit{-Oui, je vais bien,} Riley dit, en grinçant des dents à cause de la douleur. \\
\textit{-Ton genou saigne, ta blessure a l'air sérieuse. Tu devrais rentrer chez toi,} l'un de ses amis suggéra. \\

Riley refusa avec entêtement au début et dit que ce n'était qu'une égratignure avec une expression courageuse. \\
Mais, après que ses amis insistèrent, il finit par rentrer chez lui en boitant avec l'aide de l'un des enfants qui habitait près de lui. \\

\textit{-Est-ce que tu as très mal ?} Son ami demanda en le supportant avec un bras autour de son épaule. \\
\textit{-Non. Pas vraiment. Ça brûle un peu, c'est tout. J'aurais pu continuer à jouer...} Riley répondit avec une grimace en prenant un autre pas. \\

Son ami remarqua qu'il avait clairement mal mais ne le contredit pas et une fois qu'ils arrivèrent devant la maison de Riley, il lui souhaita un bon rétablissement et lui dit au revoir. \\

\textit{-Prends soin de toi ! On a besoin de toi dans l'équipe !} \\

\textit{-Merci pour ton aide !} Riley lui fit un geste de la main en guise d'au revoir et sonna à la porte. \\

Il bougea en faisant attention et mit son poids sur sa jambe qui n'était pas blessée puis prit un grand souffle. \\
La douleur avait commencé à s'intensifier. \\

Alors qu'il attendait qu'on lui ouvre la porte, il se concentra pour s'empêcher de pleurer. \\
Ses yeux avaient commencé à larmoyer mais il ne voulait pas montrer sa faiblesse et il ne voulait pas inquiéter ses parents. \\

\textit{-Salut mon chéri,} sa mère le salua avec un sourire qui se transforma en une expression d'inquiétude en voyant son genou qui saignait. \\
\textit{Qu'est-ce qui t'est arrivé, Riley ?!} demanda-t-elle, horrifiée. \\

\textit{-J'ai fait une petite chute en jouant,} dit-il en s'éclaircissant la gorge. \\

\textit{-Viens à l'intérieur, mon chou. Laisse-moi voir ta blessure,} dit sa mère en l'aidant. \\

Une fois à l'intérieur, les deux allèrent dans la salle de bain et nettoyèrent la blessure de Riley avant de sécher son genou et d'appliquer une pommade antiseptique sur ses égratignures. \\

Sa mère mit un pansement sur son genou et l'aida à monter à sa chambre pour qu'il puisse s'allonger et se reposer. \\

Mais lorsqu'elle l'aida à enlever ses chaussures, elle remarqua que son pied était enflé et après l'avoir touché un peu, elle soupçonna qu'il avait foulé sa cheville en trébuchant. \\

Elle appela leur voisin qui était médecin pour la voir et quand ils déterminèrent que ce n'était rien de grave et qu'une visite à l'hôpital n'était pas nécessaire, elle appliqua un peu d'alcool chirurgical sur son pied et lui fit un bandage. \\

\textit{-Tiens, laisse-moi mettre ça sous ton pied,} dit-elle en mettant un petit coussin sous son mollet. \\
Puis, elle se mit à côté de lui sur le bord de son lit et caressa sa joue. \\

\textit{-Mon pauvre petit garçon. Tu dois avoir tellement mal,} dit-elle avec un triste sourire. \\
\textit{-Non. Je vais bien, Maman,} Riley la rassura. \\

\textit{-Tu peux exprimer ta douleur, mon chéri. Ça ira,} sa mère lui dit avec un regard complice. \\
\textit{D'ailleurs, pleurer peut apaiser ta douleur.} \\

\textit{-Les garçons ne pleurent pas, Maman,} dit Riley, déterminé. \\
Sa mère fronça ses sourcils, surprise. \\

\textit{-C'est n'importe quoi,} dit-elle. \textit{Qui est-ce qui t'a dit ça ?} \\

Riley haussa ses épaules et la regarda comme si c'était trop évident pour en parler. \\
Sa mère soupira et prit un moment avant de reprendre la parole. \\

\textit{-Papa est un garçon, n'est-ce pas ?} \\

\textit{-Papa est un homme,} Riley déclara avec conviction. \\
Sa mère sourit avec indulgence. \\

\textit{-C'est vrai. Papa est un homme,} elle le regarda avec un sourcil levé. \\
\textit{Mais il pleure, n'est-ce pas ?} \\

Riley sourit. \\
\textit{-Tout le temps,} répondit-il. \\

\textit{-Et comme la fois où il avait marché sur un oursin de mer, tu t'en souviens ?} \\

Riley rigola et hocha la tête. \\
\textit{-Pour être honnête, ça paraissait très douloureux. Il avait crié à chaque fois que tu enlevais une des aiguilles avec tes pinces.} \\

Sa mère fronça son nez en se rappelant du souvenir avant de secouer sa tête. \\
\textit{-Et quand Lisa est morte...} ajouta-t-elle. \\

Riley hocha tristement la tête. \\
Lisa était leur chienne et toute la famille était attristée par sa mort. \\

\textit{-Et il y avait cette fois,} sa mère dit avec un sourire d'amusement. \\
\textit{-Quand ta petite sœur est née.} \\

Le petit garçon roula ses yeux au ciel avec un sourire. \\
\textit{-Je ne sais pas ce qu'il y avait d'aussi triste cette fois-là !} \\

Sa mère ria et lui dit que c'étaient probablement des larmes de joie. \\

\textit{-La morale, c'est que ton père exprime toujours ses sentiments et il n'a pas de problèmes pour pleurer quand il en a besoin.} \\
\textit{Alors, est-ce que cela fait de lui quelqu'un de faible ?} demanda-t-elle. \\

\textit{-Non. Papa est l'un des hommes les plus forts que je connaisse !} Riley répondit avec enthousiasme. \\

\textit{-Et est-ce que cela fait de lui un homme inférieur ?} \\

Il secoua la tête, indiquant qu'il ne pensait pas que c'était le cas. \\

\textit{-Alors qu'est-ce qui te fait croire que les garçons ne doivent pas pleurer quand ils ont mal ?} demanda-t-elle sur un ton doux et gentil. \\

Il la regarda avec un faible sourire et haussa ses épaules. \\
\textit{-Je veux juste être courageux, Maman.} \\

\textit{-Et c'est très bien, mon chéri. Mais être courageux ne veut pas dire retenir ses larmes.} \\
\textit{Le vrai courage, c'est de s'exprimer sans avoir peur de ce que les autres vont penser de nous.} \\

\textit{Je sais que tu es brave et ton père, ta sœur ainsi que tous tes amis le savent aussi. Même si tu pleures quand tu as mal.} \\

Riley hocha la tête, ayant compris ce qu'elle lui disait. \\
Personne ne lui avait jamais dit qu'il ne pouvait pas pleurer et il avait plein d'amis qui pleuraient quand ils se faisaient mal en jouant. \\

Son visage se relaxa soudainement et son expression indiqua enfin à quel point il avait mal. \\
Il regarda sa mère. \\
\textit{-En vérité, ça fait vraiment mal, Maman.} \\

\textit{-Oh, mon chou. Viens là !} Sa mère le prit dans ses bras et après quelques moments, Riley eut la sensation que son genou et son pied ne lui faisaient plus aussi mal.

(French) (Reading Comprehension Exercise) D G (With Answer)

Un beau matin de printemps, tandis que les fleurs étaient en éclosion et que les arbres secouaient leurs belles feuilles vertes, une enseignante annonça à sa classe qu'elle avait imprimé les photos prises durant leur voyage d'étude. \\
\textit{-J'ai fait quelques copies pour tout le monde !} leur dit-elle avec un joyeux sourire. \\

Les enfants poussèrent des cris de joie et papotèrent entre eux avec excitation quand ils reçurent les enveloppes contenant les images en question. \\
Freya, une des élèves de cette classe, ouvrit l'enveloppe et regarda les images ayant immortalisé leur sortie avec joie avant de les remettre dans son sac à dos, bien à l'abri entre deux livres pour éviter qu'elles ne se froissent. \\

Elle avait hâte de les montrer à ses parents et elle savait qu'ils les aimeraient autant qu'elle les avait aimées. \\
Une fois chez elle, son père choisit les images qu'il avait jugées les plus joyeuses et les encadra avant de les suspendre avec les autres photos de la famille sur le mur du couloir. \\

\textit{-Ton sourire est si grand dans ces photos, ma chérie,} dit-il à Freya alors que les deux admirèrent les photos qui avaient été ajoutées récemment. \\
Elle hocha la tête en accord. \\
Le voyage avait été très amusant et elle n'avait même pas eu besoin de sourire pour les photos vu qu'elle n'avait pas passé un moment sans sourire à travers la journée. \\

Le regard de Freya atterrit sur les autres photos qui étaient sur le mur et elle remarqua qu'elles étaient toutes des photos des membres de sa famille souriant avec joie ou bien même en train de rire. \\
Chaque photo produisait une joyeuse ambiance. \\

\textit{-Je me demande si...} murmura-t-elle à elle-même quand elle commença à y penser. \\
Maintenant qu'elle avait ça en tête, c'était le cas dans chaque maison où elle avait été : seulement des images ayant des personnes heureuses comme sujets étaient exposées sur les murs, bureaux et cheminées. \\

Pourquoi donc ? \\
\textit{-Peut-être parce que les gens sont affectés par les photos ?} pensa-t-elle en marchant le long du couloir. \\

C'était logique. Le plus de temps qu'elle passait à regarder les photos, le plus sa joie augmentait. \\
Elle vit une image de sa première fois où elle avait attrapé un poisson, quand elle avait accompagné son père au lac et sourit avec fierté. \\

\textit{-C'était une très bonne journée...} avoua-t-elle. \\

Puis, elle vit une photo qui avait été prise lorsque toute la famille était partie en voyage sur la route et rigola. \\
C'était tellement amusant malgré que son grand frère avait passé son temps à se plaindre sur le fait qu'il n'y avait pas d'internet. \\

La photo suivante qu'elle admira avait été prise lors de sa fête d'anniversaire. \\
La famille avait organisé la fête dans un restaurant et tous ses amis avaient été invités. \\
C'était tellement élégant et la nourriture était délicieuse et elle avait adoré chaque moment. \\

Elle se rappela qu'ils l'avaient taquinée en mettant de la crème chantilly sur son visage et rigola sur ce souvenir. \\

Ce n'était pas surprenant que ces photos étaient là, chacune d'elles reflétait des souvenirs heureux et inspiraient un sentiment de joie chez la personne qui les regardait. \\

Voulant explorer d'autres aspects de sa théorie, elle demanda à son père de lui donner l'album familial pour qu'elle puisse regarder les autres photos qui n'avaient pas mérité un emplacement d'honneur sur le mur. \\

Quand elle commença à feuilleter l'album, quelques-unes la firent rire à haute voix et quelques-unes la firent grimacer tandis que certaines la rendirent nostalgique et un peu triste. \\

La photo prise d'elle à l'âge de quatre ans vêtue d'un costume de fée et tenant une baguette magique la fit rigoler. \\
Elle adorait se déguiser et mettre des costumes ridicules comme celui-là quand elle était plus jeune et elle jouait toujours le rôle du personnage ayant inspiré son déguisement. \\

Toute la famille lui avait dit qu'elle se baladait autour de la maison en les touchant avec la baguette magique et en leur disant qu'elle venait d'exhausser leurs vœux et malgré qu'elle se rappelait à peine de cette journée, elle trouva quand même l'anecdote amusante. \\

Une autre image qui n'était pas aussi drôle captura son attention. \\
C'était une photo d'elle avec le visage enflé et avec une vilaine rougeur. \\
Elle avait mangé des noix pour la première fois et il s'était avéré qu'elle était allergique. \\

\textit{-J'ai l'air tellement bizarre...} murmura-t-elle à elle-même en regardant son visage tout rouge et ses yeux larmoyants. \\
\textit{Je suis tellement contente que cette photo n'est pas sur le mur d'honneur !} soupira-t-elle en secouant la tête. \\

Si ce n'était pas pour la crainte d'énerver ses parents, elle aurait jeté cette photo à la poubelle. \\
Elle pouvait s'imaginer faire la grimace à chaque fois qu'elle passerait par le couloir si cette photo y était. \\

C'était une image qui n'inspirait pas de joie en elle du tout. \\

Une autre photo l'arrêta et elle passa un moment à la regarder. \\
C'était une image de sa vieille maison. \\
Avant que sa famille ne déménage et ne s'installe dans leur maison actuelle, ils vivaient dans une très belle maison avec un grand jardin et une cabane dans un arbre. \\

Elle adorait y vivre et jouer dans la cabane avec ses anciens amis et cet endroit lui manquait tellement. \\
C'était tellement dommage qu'ils durent quitter cette maison à cause du travail de son père. \\

Malgré qu'elle avait aimé cet endroit, Freya était contente de ne pas s'en souvenir chaque jour. \\
Elle n'aimait pas trop le sentiment de nostalgie qu'elle ressentait en pensant à ces jours passés. \\

La dernière photo qu'elle avait regardée avant de fermer l'album était une photo de son grand-père décédé. \\
Freya l'aimait tellement et elle était si triste de ne plus jamais pouvoir le voir. \\

Sa mère lui avait dit qu'ils se souviendraient toujours de lui et qu'ils l'aimeraient à jamais et qu'il ne les avait pas vraiment quittés du moment qu'ils pensaient à lui, mais la petite fille ne put s'empêcher de ressentir de la tristesse en regardant sa photo. \\

Comme celle de son ancienne maison, elle pensait qu'il était pour le bien de tout le monde de ne pas voir cette image souvent à cause de la peine qu'elle ressentait en la regardant même si elle l'aimait très fort. \\

\textit{-Je comprends maintenant pourquoi seules les photos joyeuses sont sur le mur,} dit-elle avant de retourner en bas et de donner l'album à son père. \\

\textit{-Les photos ne nous rappellent pas seulement les souvenirs du passé mais aussi les sentiments qu'on a ressentis quand elles ont été prises.}

(French) (Reading Comprehension Exercise) D G (With Answer)

Les sons assourdis des gouttes d'eau tapant sur le toit étaient le seul bruit qui raisonnait dans la maison. \\
Oliver se tourna à droite et à gauche dans son lit et ne parvint pas à s'endormir. \\
Le courant était coupé à cause de la tempête et il ne pouvait même pas allumer la télévision. \\
Sa chambre était sombre, éclairée que par la lumière de l'éclair occasionnellement. \\
Il laissa échapper un soupir misérable, il était tellement ennuyé et même un peu effrayé. \\

Il se leva et fit son chemin à travers sa chambre lentement pour aller à la chambre de son frère et malheureusement, il se cogna le pied contre le cadre de la porte. \\
\textit{-Ouille !} murmura-t-il, n'osant pas parler à haute voix. \\

Quand il arriva enfin à la porte de son frère, des bruits forts de quelqu'un qui frappait à la porte le firent sursauter. \\
Qui pourrait bien leur rendre visite à cette heure ? Et au bon milieu d'une tempête ? \\
Oh, non... Oliver avait vu assez de films d'horreur pour savoir comment ça allait finir ! \\

Son frère ouvrit la porte de sa chambre, le faisant sursauter de surprise. \\
\textit{-Qu'est-ce que tu fais là, mon grand ?} son frère demanda. \\

\textit{-Je m'ennuyais...} Oliver dit en haussant les épaules. \\
\textit{-Est-ce qu'on vient de frapper à la porte ? J'avais mes écouteurs aux oreilles et donc je ne suis pas sûr.} \\

Oliver hocha la tête et jeta un regard aux escaliers avec agitation. \\
La personne qui avait frappé à la porte venait de le refaire et ne s'arrêta pas cette fois-ci. \\

Ses parents choisirent ce moment-là pour quitter leur chambre. \\
\textit{-Pourquoi êtes-vous debout à cette heure ?} leur mère demanda avec mécontentement tandis que leur père descendit l'escalier pour voir qui frappait à leur porte. \\

Les deux garçons ne répondirent pas et l'aîné suivit son père en bas. \\
Oliver préféra rester avec sa mère et quand les deux entendirent le bruit de la porte qu'on ouvrait, ils descendirent avec hésitation pour voir qui était leur visiteur impatient. \\

\textit{-Julie ?!} sa mère demanda avec étonnement en voyant une femme tremblante devant la porte enlever son manteau trempé. \\
\textit{-Quelle tempête !} la femme dit, son visage crispé et contrarié. \\

\textit{-Qu'est-ce qui t'a fait venir à cette heure ?} la mère d'Oliver demanda. \\

Mais c'était son père qui prit la parole. \\
\textit{-J'étais en train de lui poser la même question.} \\

\textit{-Je voulais vous surprendre. Je viens de rentrer de mon voyage et j'ai conduit une voiture de location jusqu'ici. Comme une idiote, je n'ai pas vu la météo et le motel où j'avais prévu de rester sur mon chemin était complet et donc je n'avais pas d'autres choix que de continuer à conduire malgré que je savais que j'allais arriver à cette heure inappropriée.} La dame expliqua rapidement. \\

Le temps qu'il faisait l'avait clairement rendu de mauvaise humeur. \\

Oliver regarda son frère et vit que, comme lui, il était surpris de voir cette dame ici. Peut-être qu'il ne savait pas qui c'était non plus ? Il allait devoir lui demander plus tard. \\

Le petit garçon fronça ses sourcils et la regarda de la tête aux pieds. \\
Elle était habillée complètement en noir : des pantalons noirs, une blouse noire, un manteau noir et des bottes noires. \\

Même ses cheveux étaient noirs d'après ce qu'il pouvait voir grâce à la torche de son père. \\

\textit{-Et je vois qu'il n'y a pas de courant en plus. Génial !} dit la dame avec amertume. \\
\textit{-Viens avec moi, je vais te donner des serviettes pour te sécher les cheveux. Je suppose que tu as ramené tes vêtements avec toi ?} la mère d'Oliver demanda. \\

\textit{-Oui, mais il n'y a aucune chance que je ressorte sous la pluie pour les chercher dans la voiture !} Julie répondit en tremblant. \\

\textit{-Tu devrais lui prêter quelque chose pour ce soir, ma chérie. Je vais faire chauffer de l'eau pour une tasse de thé bien chaud,} le papa d'Oliver suggéra et quand leur invité marcha en avant pour aller avec sa mère, elle vit le petit garçon. \\

\textit{-Oh, salut petit. Tu dois être Oly.} dit-elle. \\

\textit{-Oliver,} il la corrigea. \\

\textit{-D'accord. Et bien, à demain.} Et sur ce, elle s'en alla. \\

Le père d'Oliver lui demanda à lui et à son frère de retourner en haut et les deux garçons obéirent. \\

En montant, Oliver demanda à son frère s'il avait déjà entendu parler de cette personne. Était-elle un membre éloigné de la famille ou un truc du genre ? \\

\textit{-C'est l'amie de maman de l'université, elles étaient inséparables et elles sont restées en contact. La seule autre fois où elle est venue, c'était quand tu étais un petit bébé, c'est pour ça que tu ne te rappelles pas d'elle,} le plus âgé des deux garçons expliqua. \\

Oliver n'avait pas du tout aimé cette dame. Il la trouva suspicieuse. \\
Il était clair que ses parents la connaissaient et ils se comportaient comme s'ils lui faisaient confiance, la laissant entrer chez eux et tout, mais il avait un mauvais pressentiment la concernant. \\

Oliver lâcha soudainement un souffle horrifié en ayant une pensée effrayante. \\
Et si cette femme était en réalité une sorcière métamorphe qui s'était fait passer pour l'amie de maman ?! Oh, non ! Et quand tout le monde serait endormi, elle les tuerait tous ! \\

Il entendit les voix de sa mère et de la fausse Julie parler tandis qu'elle s'installait dans la chambre d'invités et décida d'aller la confronter quand ses parents retourneraient dans leur chambre. \\

Il attendit une demi-heure environ et quand il était sûr que la voie était libre, il se faufila hors de sa chambre en silence. \\

La porte de la chambre d'invités était légèrement ouverte et il vit qu'il y avait une bougie allumée à l'intérieur. \\
La lumière produite par la flamme projetait des ombres intenses contre le mur et il put voir la silhouette courbée de la fausse Julie qui était assise sur le lit à un angle étrange et il entendit les sons de toux et de crachats. \\

Elle était sûrement en train de reprendre sa forme d'origine ! \\

Il ouvrit la porte, faisant tourner la fausse Julie vers lui avec un sursaut. \\
\textit{-Oh, c'est toi ! Tu m'as fait peur, petit !} dit-elle avec une main sur sa poitrine. \\

Elle avait toujours une apparence humaine et en marchant à l'intérieur de la chambre, il vit qu'elle tenait une serviette en papier. \\

\textit{-Julie,} avait un sourire penaud aux lèvres et elle mit un doigt devant elle. \\
\textit{-Ne dis pas à ton père, mais ce thé est dégueulasse !} \\

Oliver comprit que le son qu'il avait entendu était fait par elle en crachant le thé dans le mouchoir et il rigola d'amusement. \\
Le thé de son père était infect, il le savait par expérience ! \\

\textit{-Hé, tu veux un peu de chocolat ? Je l'ai apporté avec moi de mon voyage en Suisse !} Julie dit en sortant une barre de chocolat de son sac. \\
\textit{-Ne dis pas à ta maman, par contre. Je suis sûre qu'elle n'approuverait pas le fait que tu manges des sucreries la nuit.} \\

Elle lui fit un clin d'œil avec un sourire espiègle. \\
Oliver prit la barre de chocolat et s'assit sur le lit à côté d'elle. \\

\textit{-Tu as été en Suisse ?} demanda-t-il avec curiosité. \\

\textit{-Ouai. Tu veux voir des photos ?} Elle n'attendit pas sa réponse et prit son téléphone de la table de chevet. \\

Olivier passa la nuit avec qui il appela maintenant Tante Julie, il avait écouté ses histoires sur ses voyages autour du monde et sur le temps qu'elle avait passé avec sa mère à l'université quand elles étaient plus jeunes. \\

Quand il s'endormit, sa dernière pensée était que Tante Julie était la plus gentille, la plus cool et la plus drôle des sorcières métamorphes au monde !

(French) (Reading Comprehension Exercise) D G (With Answer)

\textit{-N'oublie pas ton parapluie, ma chérie. La météo a annoncé qu'il allait peut-être pleuvoir aujourd'hui aussi,} Madame Sanders dit à sa fille depuis la cuisine en l'entendant ouvrir la porte. \\

\textit{-Oui, maman !} Amy répondit en prenant son parapluie du porte-manteau où il était posé. \\

La fillette mit ses bras dans les bretelles de son cartable et arrangea son bonnet en laine avant de quitter la maison. \\

En route vers l'école, elle chantonna doucement en sautant au-delà des flaques d'eau produites par la pluie de la nuit passée. \\

Elle regarda le ciel et vit les nuages gris qui indiquaient que sa mère avait raison de prêter tant d'attention à la météo. \\

Si les nuages dans le ciel indiquaient quoi que ce soit, c'était qu'il allait pleuvoir à travers la journée. \\

Amy commença à balancer son parapluie en pensant aux présentateurs de la météo. \\

Est-ce qu'ils devaient voyager partout à travers le monde pour voir quel temps il allait faire là-bas ? \\

Si c'était le cas, la petite fille pensa que c'était le travail le plus cool au monde. \\

Comme ça devait être super de voyager partout juste pour voir le ciel et de dire aux gens de ne pas oublier de mettre leurs manteaux ou d'annuler leurs plans de pique-nique ! \\

Ou bien, peut-être qu'ils allaient dans l'espace pour faire leur travail ? \\

C'était logique, vu qu'ils seraient plus capables de voir comment les nuages bougeaient d'en haut, n'est-ce pas ? \\

Ça aussi c'était très cool, par contre ! \\

Le fait de porter ces combinaisons d'espace et de monter sur une navette spatiale serait génial ! \\

Ou bien... est-ce qu'ils communiquaient simplement avec les extraterrestres qui leur disaient comment les choses allaient progresser sur terre ?! \\

Amy s'arrêta de marcher et laissa échapper un souffle en pensant à ça. \\

Si c'était le cas, alors les extraterrestres existent vraiment ! \\

Elle vit un groupe d'oiseaux voler loin de la ville et se souvint que leur enseignant leur avait dit une fois qu'ils migraient vers des régions plus chaudes. \\

Mais comment savaient-ils quand il allait faire plus froid ? \\

Avaient-ils des diffusions de météo aussi ? \\

Elle rigola et reprit son chemin. \\

Cette pensée était ridicule ! \\

Mais elle était très curieuse sur comment un présentateur de météo faisait son travail et elle décida de poser la question à son enseignant avant la récréation. \\

Une fois arrivée en classe, Amy compta les minutes avec impatience, ayant hâte de poser ses questions et de résoudre le mystère qu'elle avait en tête depuis ce matin. \\

Quand la cloche sonna enfin, elle se dirigea rapidement vers le bureau de l'enseignant et demanda quelques moments de son temps. \\

\textit{-Comment savent les présentateurs de la météo quand et où il va pleuvoir et quand il va faire beau et tout ?} demanda-t-elle quand il lui prêta son attention. \\

\textit{-Et bien, tout d'abord, tu dois connaître la différence entre un présentateur de météo et un météorologiste,} son enseignant lui dit avant de commencer son explication. \\

\textit{Les présentateurs de météo sont des gens qui présentent la météo à la télévision. Ils reçoivent des rapports et les lisent en indiquant des endroits du pays sur l'écran. Les météorologistes sont les gens qui préparent ces rapports. Ce sont des savants qui étudient le climat et la météo et font des prédictions sur quel temps il va faire au futur.} \\

Amy hocha la tête, intéressée. \\

\textit{-Et, comment font-ils ces prédictions ?} \\

\textit{-Ils utilisent des informations sur l'état de la météo au passé et mesurent son état actuel au présent et ils devinent son état au futur en se basant sur ça.} \\

Amy fronça ses sourcils, son enseignant n'avait pas vraiment tout expliqué. \\

\textit{-D'accord, mais comment est-ce qu'ils obtiennent les informations dont ils ont besoin ? Est-ce qu'il leur suffit de regarder le ciel ou...?} \\

\textit{-Oh ! Ils utilisent des outils comme des thermomètres pour mesurer la température, des baromètres pour mesurer la pression de l'air et des anémomètres pour mesurer la vitesse du vent.} \\

\textit{Ils utilisent aussi des images prises à partir de satellites pour observer la distribution des nuages dans le ciel.} \\

\textit{Quand ils ont les données nécessaires, ils les introduisent dans des ordinateurs qui utilisent des équations spéciales pour faire des calculs qui produisent par la suite des modèles qui les aident à prédire la météo.} \\

\textit{Ces modèles ne sont pas toujours précis par contre et les savants doivent les réviser pour voir s'ils sont cohérents ou pas.} \\

\textit{Il est très important que la météo soit aussi précise que possible parce que non seulement elle nous dit quand il va pleuvoir pour qu'on évite d'être trempés, elle nous prévient aussi quand il va y avoir de dangereux phénomènes comme des ouragans et elle nous aide à rester en sécurité.} \\

\textit{Les fermiers, les marins et les pilotes comptent beaucoup sur la météo dans leur travail et même les sportifs.} \\

Les yeux d'Amy s'élargirent par confusion. \\

\textit{-Comment est-ce que la météo peut affecter le travail de ces gens ?} \\

\textit{-Et bien, les fermiers ont besoin de savoir s'il va pleuvoir pour planter les graines appropriées.} \\

\textit{Quelques plantes grandissent dans des environnements pluviaux et d'autres ne peuvent pas survivre si le temps est trop humide.} \\

\textit{Les marins ont besoin de savoir s'il va y avoir des tempêtes pour prendre leurs précautions et rester en sécurité à la mer.} \\

\textit{Et c'est la même chose pour les pilotes, ils ne peuvent pas faire voler des avions dans des conditions météorologiques difficiles et les sportifs ne peuvent pas jouer comme il le faut sous la pluie.} \\

\textit{Tu imagines ce que ça ferait de jouer dans un terrain glissant ?} \\

Amy rigola en imaginant les grands joueurs de football américain que son père aimait regarder glisser dans la boue en courant à travers le terrain. \\

Elle n'aimerait pas être à leur place ! \\

Et rien qu'en pensant au mal de mer et à la nausée qu'on peut avoir en étant dans un bateau qui bascule la fit faire une grimace. \\

Elle n'avait jamais vraiment réalisé à quel point la météo était importante et malgré qu'elle était un peu déçue par le fait que ni les présentateurs ni les météorologistes ne voyageaient ni n'allaient dans l'espace pour faire leurs recherches, elle pensait quand même que c'était un métier très intéressant. \\

Tellement intéressant, d'ailleurs, qu'elle voulut en savoir plus et il n'y avait pas de meilleur endroit pour commencer que la bibliothèque. \\

\textit{-Merci beaucoup pour vos explications, Monsieur Brown !} dit-elle avec enthousiasme avant de prendre sa carte de bibliothèque et de courir hors de la salle de classe. \\

Elle avait juste assez de temps pour obtenir quelques livres avant la fin de la récréation !

(French) (Reading Comprehension Exercise) D G (With Answer)

Marty était très content de passer la journée chez son ami. Les deux enfants passèrent la matinée à jouer au football dans le jardin et passèrent même un peu de temps avec le chien avant de rentrer dans la maison pour déjeuner. \\

Quand ils allèrent à l'étage dans la chambre de son ami pour passer le reste de la journée à jouer aux jeux vidéos, un petit carnet attira l'attention de Marty. \\

\textit{-C'est quoi ça, sur ton bureau ?} demanda-t-il en regardant l'objet. \\

\textit{-Oh ! C'est une collection de timbres,} son ami répondit. \textit{Mon père reçoit des lettres de partout dans le monde de ses correspondants. Je ne sais pas pourquoi ils n'utilisent pas simplement le téléphone ou les e-mails, mais à chaque fois qu'il reçoit une lettre, il me laisse prendre le timbre de l'enveloppe. Je les trouve très cool et donc j'ai commencé à les collectionner il y a environ un an. Jettes-y un coup d'œil si tu veux !} \\

Marty, intrigué par le concept de collectionner des petits morceaux de papier, accepta l'offre de son ami et commença à feuilleter les pages du carnet. \\

Il regarda les timbres avec fascination. Quelques-uns avaient des images de personnes sur eux, d'autres avaient des paysages tandis que certains avaient des machines, des trains et des animaux. \\

Il avait aimé les couleurs des timbres, mais ce qui l'intéressa le plus était la collection en elle-même. Les seules choses qu'il avait collectionnées dans sa vie étaient des armures dans un jeu et malgré qu'il s'en était vanté devant ses amis, il ne pensait pas que c'était aussi intéressant que la collection de timbres de son ami, qui resta dans sa tête jusqu'à ce qu'il rentre chez lui. \\

En réalité, il avait vraiment envie de commencer une collection à lui. Mais... que pouvait-il collectionner ? À ce qu'il savait, aucun de ses parents n'avaient de correspondants étrangers qui leur envoyaient des lettres et donc, il ne pouvait pas collectionner des timbres. \\

Il supposa qu'il pouvait collectionner ce qu'il voulait et c'était bien ça le problème, il n'avait aucune idée sur quoi choisir ! \\

Il s'installa devant son ordinateur et chercha quelques idées en ligne. \\

Certaines personnes collectionnaient des fleurs séchées, apparemment, ce qui ne l'intéressa pas vraiment car les seules fleurs qu'il y avait dans le jardin de sa maison étaient des roses. \\

Il trouva aussi des gens qui collectionnaient des pièces de monnaie provenant de différents pays, c'était intéressant mais il ne voyageait pas et donc cette option avait été abandonnée. \\

Certaines personnes collectionnaient des bandes dessinées et il pensa qu'il préférait regarder des dessins animés au lieu de lire des bandes dessinées et les acheter rien que pour les collectionner était du gâchis. \\

L'un des objets collectionnés les plus bizarres qu'il trouva étaient des papillons. \\

\textit{-Argh, c'est tellement flippant...} murmura-t-il à lui-même. \\

Il ne savait pas vraiment pourquoi les gens voudraient garder des cadavres de papillons chez eux, mais en y pensant, les collections de fleurs séchées étaient presque la même chose. \\

Il vit aussi qu'il était possible de collectionner des pierres minérales et des cristaux mais il n'était pas vraiment intéressé par ce type d'objets et il ne voulait pas aller en randonnée pour les trouver. \\

L'une des choses les plus intéressantes que les gens collectionnaient étaient les médailles et il trouva ça très cool, il les collectionnerait peut-être une fois que son équipe de foot à l'école commencerait les compétitions. \\

Pour l'instant, il allait continuer à chercher. \\

Dans un article, il lut qu'on pouvait collectionner n'importe quoi, du moment que c'est quelque chose que l'on aime et qu'il n'y avait pas de règles. \\

Les gens collectionnaient des trucs qu'ils aimaient et qui les amusaient. \\

Il passa quelques instants à penser à ce qu'il aimait le plus et les seules choses auxquelles il pouvait penser étaient les jeux vidéos, le football, le chocolat et le skating. \\

Il ne pouvait pas exactement collectionner les jeux vu qu'il les téléchargeait en ligne et le foot était un sport, pas quelque chose que l'on collectionne ! \\

Mais... il pouvait collectionner des ballons. \\

\textit{-Trop grands...} il se dit en secouant la tête. \\

Il n'avait pas assez d'espace dans sa chambre où il pourrait les garder. \\

La même chose s'appliquait pour les skateboards. \\

Et ils étaient trop chers en plus. \\

La seule chose qui restait était le chocolat. \\

Marty fronça les sourcils, ça serait vraiment du gâchis d'acheter des friandises juste pour les mettre dans une boîte, alors là le chocolat. \\

Et, pour être honnête, il ne se faisait pas confiance pour ne pas les manger immédiatement après les avoir achetées. \\

C'était juste trop bon ! \\

Par contre, le chocolat était très varié et avait beaucoup de formes et de parfums, les variétés étaient presque infinies ! \\

Et donc, ça serait quelque chose d'intéressant à collectionner. \\

Humm, que faire ? Il eut soudainement une idée qui pourrait régler ses problèmes. \\

Il pourrait simplement collectionner les emballages ! Oui, tous les types de chocolat étaient emballés ou dans une boîte. \\

Comme ça il pourrait manger le chocolat et collectionner les emballages. \\

Tout le monde gagne ! \\

\textit{-Je suis un génie !} il pensa avec fierté. \\

Il ouvrit un tiroir et y fouilla pour un moment avant d'en sortir une barre de chocolat qu'il y avait gardée. \\

\textit{-Ça va être le premier élément de ma collection,} dit-il avant d'aller sur son bureau et de prendre un carnet neuf. \\

\textit{-Je vais coller les emballages ici.} \\

Il avait pensé que l'idée de son ami de garder les timbres dans un carnet était intelligente et il voulait faire la même chose. \\

Il prépara du ruban adhésif et un feutre pour noter la date du jour et écrire une petite note et il déballa la barre de chocolat. \\

Il savoura son goût sucré et une fois qu'il en avait fini, il utilisa une lingette pour nettoyer les quelques endroits où il y avait du chocolat fondu collé à l'intérieur de l'emballage. \\

Une fois que le tout avait séché, il étendit l'emballage et le mit sur une page du carnet avant de l'y fixer avec du ruban adhésif. \\

Il écrivit avec son feutre sur la page sous l'emballage et ferma le carnet avec un sourire satisfait. \\

Il resta en place pour un moment avant de courir hors de sa chambre pour parler à ses parents de son nouveau loisir. \\

Après tout, il avait besoin de leur soutien pour acheter le chocolat et étendre sa collection ! \\

Ses parents étaient amusés et après qu'il eut promis d'être responsable et de ne pas manger trop de chocolat, ils approuvèrent.

(French) (Reading Comprehension Exercise) D G (With Answer)

Tôt le matin, Monsieur Adler entra dans la classe et salua ses élèves avec grande joie. Il aimait vraiment enseigner et jouer un rôle dans l'éducation des futurs dirigeants du monde. Il aimait leur apprendre de nouvelles choses et se réjouit de voir quand ils faisaient preuve d'avoir appris leurs leçons, que cela soit en utilisant de nouveaux mots qu'ils avaient appris ou par la résolution correcte d'une équation mathématique. \\

Étant quelqu'un qui passait la majorité de sa journée avec ces enfants, il connaissait bien ses petits apprentis et il savait que certaines leçons étaient plus à leurs goûts que d'autres. Par exemple, bien qu'ils aient aimé la session de lecture d'hier, il savait que la leçon de mathématiques d'aujourd'hui n'allait pas être reçue avec beaucoup d'enthousiasme. \\

Et, comme il avait deviné, la réaction des élèves variait de soupirs déçus à quelques plaintes que les mathématiques étaient ennuyeuses. M. Adler posa son menton sur sa main et réfléchit pendant quelques minutes. \\

Il regarda hors de la fenêtre et fit une grimace en voyant la pluie. Les enfants n'allaient pas pouvoir sortir dehors pour la récréation et il ne voulait pas que leurs humeurs deviennent pires en étudiant quelque chose qui ne les amusait pas, en plus du fait de ne pas pouvoir sortir pour jouer. \\

Il voulait que l'école soit un endroit amusant pour eux et il décida de faire preuve de compassion. Il pourrait retarder la leçon d'une heure environ. \\

\textit{-Bon, d'accord. Alors, que dites-vous de ceci :} il commença en se penchant sur son bureau. \textit{Et si vous jouez le rôle d'enseignant pour cette session ?} \\

Les enfants se regardèrent en confusion avant de tourner leur attention sur lui et lui demander ce qu'il voulait dire par ça. \\

\textit{-Eh bien, je veux que chacun de vous nous enseigne quelque chose. Vous allez avoir cinq minutes chacun pour nous enseigner ce que vous voulez. Juste un petit truc simple que vous savez faire.} \\

\textit{-Ohhh ! C'est beaucoup plus intéressant que d'additionner des nombres !} l'un des enfants dit, poussant les autres à parler en même temps pour exprimer leur accord avec lui. \\

\textit{-Allons, les enfants.} M. Adler les calma. \textit{Nous allons quand même avoir notre cours de maths après.} Il les informa avec un regard ferme mais pas cruel. \textit{Vous avez dix minutes pour penser à un sujet, utilisez votre temps avec sagesse.} \\

Les enfants tournèrent leur attention vers leurs cahiers et commencèrent à écrire des notes et des étapes sur différents sujets. Chacun d'eux avait pris la tâche très sérieusement et lorsque leurs dix minutes s'étaient écoulées, ils avaient tous fini leurs petits plans de leçons. \\

La première personne qui était montée au tableau était une petite fille. Elle demanda à l'enseignant de lui donner un marqueur avant de dire à ses camarades qu'elle allait leur apprendre comment dessiner un ours en peluche. \\

\textit{-Tout d'abord, vous devez dessiner un grand cercle avec un cercle plus petit sur lui en haut. C'est le corps et la tête de l'ours en peluche.} Elle expliqua en dessinant les cercles en question. \\

\textit{-Vous pouvez dessiner avec moi si vous voulez.} dit-elle par-dessus son épaule. \\

\textit{-Puis, dessinez deux demi-cercles en haut sur les côtés du cercle du haut. Ce sont les oreilles. Deux petits cercles en bas des deux côtés du grand cercle, qui sont les pieds.} Elle continua à dessiner pour leur montrer et quelques-uns des enfants dessinaient avec elle sur leurs cahiers. \\

\textit{-Pour dessiner les bras, faites deux ellipses sur les côtés du corps, dessinez-les à moitié à l'intérieur du grand cercle pour faire en sorte que l'ourson tienne son ventre.} M. Adler dût s'empêcher de rire. \\

Lucy, la fillette qui était en train de donner sa leçon, était adorable et il était très fier d'elle. \\

\textit{-Maintenant, donnons des yeux et une bouche à l'ourson. Dessinez un cercle sur la partie inférieure de la tête et un autre plus petit sur lui en haut pour faire le nez. Dessinez une ligne qui descend du nez et pour dessiner la bouche, dessinez un numéro trois allongé sur son dos comme ça !} \\

M. Adler devait avouer que son élève avait dessiné un ourson en peluche très mignon sur le tableau et il pouvait clairement voir que les autres élèves avaient aimé la leçon. \\

\textit{-Merci beaucoup, Lucy,} dit-il en l'applaudissant, ce qui poussa les autres enfants à l'applaudir aussi. \\

L'enfant suivant qui devait enseigner les autres était un garçon nommé Colin. \\

\textit{-Je vais vous apprendre comment faire un avion en papier et comment le faire voler très haut.} Il commença ensuite à plier une feuille qu'il avait emmenée avec lui au tableau. \\

Quand il avait enfin fini de la former en avion, il démontra le geste correct de sa main pour le lancer. \\

\textit{-Merci, Colin. Tes camarades ont l'air d'avoir beaucoup aimé ta leçon,} M. Adler lui dit avec amusement en regardant les enfants lancer les avions en papier haut dans l'air. \\

Après cela, une fille monta et déclara qu'elle allait apprendre à ses camarades comment faire une tresse. \\

\textit{-Je vais avoir besoin d'un volontaire. Katie, tes cheveux sont longs, tu veux bien venir et me laisser les tresser pour montrer aux autres ?} \\

Et c'était ainsi qu'une heure et demie se déroula. Les enfants avaient chacun un talent intéressant à enseigner. L'un d'eux avait utilisé ses lacets pour leur montrer comment faire des nœuds de marin, une autre apprit à ses camarades comment utiliser les mots "Quand" et "Quant" correctement, ce qui avait beaucoup impressionné M. Adler. \\

Et il y avait même un enfant qui avait montré aux autres comment faire leurs cartes de fête des mères eux-mêmes. \\

Quand tout le monde eut son tour, l'enseignant se leva et s'éloigna de son bureau. \\

\textit{-Merci beaucoup, tout le monde. J'ai appris beaucoup de choses et je suis sûr que c'est le cas pour vous aussi,} dit-il. \\

\textit{-Lequel avez-vous préféré, Monsieur Adler ?} un garçon lui demanda. \\

\textit{-Aucun. J'ai aimé toutes les leçons de manière égale,} répondit-il, préférant rester neutre. \\

\textit{-Et maintenant que nous nous sommes bien amusés, il est temps d'apprendre à additionner des nombres !} leur dit-il de manière taquine, en répétant les mots de son élève. \\

Les enfants laissèrent échapper un grognement collectif mais il était content de voir qu'ils étaient tous de meilleure humeur.

(French) (Reading Comprehension Exercise) D G (With Answer)

Deux chevaliers étaient dans le champ de bataille, avec seulement la lumière aveuglante du soleil comme leur témoin. Les deux se tenaient en position de combat et s'encerclaient. Peu de temps s'écoula avant que l'un d'eux n'attaqua l'autre avec un cri de guerre. Il se lança sur son adversaire qui bloqua son épée avec la sienne. \textit{Claque !} Seuls les bruits de fer battant le fer pouvaient s'entendre tandis que les deux s'affrontèrent. \\

Ils firent beaucoup d'efforts pour coordonner leurs mouvements, levant leurs armes pour attaquer et basculant leurs corps pour esquiver les coups de l'autre. Ce n'était que lorsque l'un d'eux exécuta un mouvement assez fort pour désarmer son adversaire que la bataille se termina. Le vainqueur se tint avec son épée pointée vers son ennemi qui avait levé les mains en l'air en signe de soumission puis baissa son arme. \\

Les deux chevaliers enlevèrent leurs casques et se serrèrent la main avec un sourire. \textit{-C'était un bel effort,} le gagnant dit. \textit{-Mais tu dois t'entraîner davantage.} Le perdant lui tira la langue et lui dit qu'il le savait déjà. \\

\textit{-Grand frère !} Un petit garçon courut soudainement vers le chevalier vainqueur. \textit{-Tu as encore gagné ! Tu es le meilleur !} Son grand frère lui ébouriffa les cheveux avant de le prendre dans ses bras puis le mit sur ses épaules. \textit{-Oui, Edward et tu vas être comme moi quand tu seras plus grand, d'ailleurs, tu seras encore meilleur que moi !} \\

Les deux allèrent à l'intérieur du château pour voir s'ils pourraient avoir quelque chose à grignoter avant le déjeuner et en faisant leur chemin vers la cuisine, ils entendirent les hauts cris de la cuisinière. \textit{-Qui était-ce ? Lequel d'entre vous a osé voler l'agneau ?} Elle hurla sur trois gardes et deux femmes de chambre. Aucun d'eux ne répondit et ils échangèrent des expressions inquiètes entre eux. \\

Le chevalier et son petit frère entrèrent dans la cuisine et quand la cuisinière les vit, son visage s'éclaira. \textit{-Ah ! Sire Maximilian ! Je suis heureuse de vous voir. Veuillez dire à ces mécréants d'admettre lequel d'eux a volé mon gigot d'agneau. Il était censé être servi sur la table du roi pour le dîner de ce soir !} Dit-elle en jetant un regard plein de réprimande sur les femmes de chambre et les gardes qui étaient là-bas. \\

\textit{-Vous... avez perdu un gigot d'agneau ?} Maximilian demanda en arquant un sourcil. \\

\textit{-Mais bien sûr que non ! Qui pourrait bien perdre un objet aussi large ? Je ne l'ai pas perdu. Il a été volé, évidement !} La cuisinière répondit en roulant les yeux au plafond. \\

Maximilian hocha la tête et s'excusa de l'avoir mal compris. \textit{-Quand l'avez-vous vu la dernière fois ?} Demanda-t-il. \\

\textit{-Il était sous la table, en train de mariner tranquillement dans une grande marmite avec des herbes et des épices. Je l'ai couvert avec ce torchon.} Elle lui montra un grand morceau de tissu. \textit{Et quand je suis retournée à la cuisine, il n'était plus là ! La marmite était vide et seul le torchon était sur la table.} Lui dit-elle avec un soupir misérable. \\

\textit{-J'ai mis un autre gigot dans la marmite pour le dîner de ce soir et donc sa majesté le roi ne va pas en souffrir, mais le coupable doit être capturé !} \\

\textit{-En effet.} Le jeune homme dit en hochant la tête. \\

\textit{-Si vous permettez, Sire Maximilian... ?} L'une des femmes de chambre dit. \\

\textit{-Allez-y, je vous en prie.} \\

\textit{-Je me suis rendu à la cuisine il y a une heure. J'ai vu la marmite vide et j'ai cru que c'était étonnant mais je ne l'ai pas touchée. Le torchon était par terre et donc je l'ai ramassé et plié avant de le mettre sur la table, puis j'ai nettoyé le sol avant d'aller dans le jardin. Je ne suis retournée que maintenant pour trouver la cuisinière en train de crier à propos du gigot perdu. Celui ou celle qui l'a pris l'a sûrement fait avant que je ne sois rentrée dans la cuisine.} La jeune femme de chambre dit. \\

Maximilian hocha la tête en signe de compréhension avant de retourner son attention aux auteurs. \textit{-Est-ce que l'un de vous s'est rendu à la cuisine avant cela ?} L'autre femme de chambre et les gardes dirent non et il trouva le fait que seuls ceux qui étaient dans la pièce travaillaient dans la cuisine. \\

Le jeune frère de Maximilian prit la parole. \textit{-Est-ce que le sol de la cuisine était sale quand vous avez mariné le gigot d'agneau ce matin ?} Le petit garçon demanda à la cuisinière avec curiosité. \\

\textit{-Non. La cuisine est toujours nettoyée la nuit et quand je suis venue préparer l'agneau, il n'y avait même pas un grain de poussière sur le sol.} La cuisinière répondit. \\

Edward demanda en plus à la femme de chambre qui avait parlé auparavant pourquoi elle avait nettoyé le sol. \\

\textit{-Parce qu'il y avait une traînée de graisses sur le sol menant à la porte arrière. Il y avait aussi de la terre sur la traînée.} Dit-elle. \\

Le petit garçon regarda son frère et dit que cela devait signifier que celui ou celle qui avait pris l'agneau devait l'avoir traîné au jardin et cela expliquerait la traînée de graisse et ce que la femme de chambre pensait être de la terre devait être les épices et les herbes. \\

\textit{-Oui, c'est logique. As-tu vu l'un des enfants traîner quelque chose hors de la cuisine ?} Son grand-frère demanda. \\

Seul un enfant aurait besoin de traîner un gigot d'agneau puisqu'un adulte serait assez fort pour le porter. \\

\textit{-Non, mais je crois que je sais qui est le voleur.} Le petit garçon prit ensuite la main de son frère et le tira hors de la cuisine et dans le jardin jusqu'à ce qu'ils arrivèrent à la niche du chien du prince. \\

Quand Maximilian s'agenouilla par terre et regarda à l'intérieur, il trouva le chien endormi, blotti autour du gigot perdu qui était à présent à moitié consommé. \\

La cuisinière, les femmes de chambre et les gardes suivirent le jeune chevalier qui se tourna vers eux avec un sourire. \textit{-Je crois que ça résout notre devinette.} Puis, il se tourna vers la cuisinière et mit un bras autour des épaules d'Edward. \textit{-Je crois qu'il a mérité une gâterie pour avoir résolu le mystère, pas vrai ?} \\

La cuisinière claqua sa langue, lamentant le gigot gâché et hocha sa tête. \textit{-Venez à la cuisine, j'ai quelques tartelettes aux fraises de ce matin qui sont encore fraîches.}

\begin{enumerate}

(French) (Reading Comprehension Exercise) D G (With Answer)

Aujourd'hui, c'était la journée des idiomes! Chaque année à l'école d'Emma, une journée était dédiée pour un jeu élaboré que les enfants jouaient où ils préparaient des costumes, un dessin, un poème ou quoi que ce soit pour indiquer et donner des indices sur un idiome particulier et leurs camarades devaient le deviner et donner sa signification. Les enseignants pensaient que c'était une façon merveilleuse d'apprendre aux enfants des idiomes populaires et leur signification et les élèves aimaient le jeu amusant, surtout car ils pouvaient choisir l'idiome qu'ils utiliseraient avec l'aide de leurs parents.

Plus l'idiome était ridicule, mieux c'était et ils firent de leur mieux chaque année pour rendre le jeu aussi amusant que possible. Emma s'assit à sa place et les enfants se calmèrent et prêtèrent attention au premier idiome. L'un de leurs camarades portait un costume de chien et quand l'enseignant leur dit qu'ils pouvaient commencer à deviner, les enfants commencèrent à dire ce qu'ils croyaient être l'idiome représenté.

\textit{-Chien en vie en vaut mieux que lion mort.} L'un des garçons dit à haute voix. Le garçon qui portait le costume fronça ses sourcils et secoua sa tête, indiquant que ce n'était pas ça.

\textit{-Chien hargneux à toujours oreille déchirée.} Un autre s'écria. Mais, sa réponse n'était pas correcte.

\textit{-Qui m'aime, aime mon chien?} Emma dit avec hésitation. C'était le seul idiome de chien qu'elle connaissait en plus de ceux qui avaient été mentionnés par les autres.

\textit{-Non. Désolé.} Le garçon dit. \textit{Voici un indice.} Il commença ensuite à aboyer.

\textit{-Les chiens aboient et la caravane passe!} Un garçon cria avec enthousiasme.

\textit{-Oui! C'est la bonne réponse.} Le garçon qui représentait l'idiome avait dit avant de commencer à expliquer que celui-ci signifie que ce que disent ou pensent les autres ne nous empêche pas d'accomplir ce qu'on veut.

L'élève suivante était une fille qui avait décidé de faire deviner son idiome petit à petit à travers une charade qu'elle allait mimer. Elle commença par lever un petit doigt.

\textit{-Le premier mot!} Emma dit et la fille hocha la tête avant de commencer à mimer la signification du premier mot. Elle toucha son poignet, la tapotant avec l'index de l'autre main.

\textit{-Une main?} Le garçon assis à côté d'Emma devina. Elle secoua son doigt, indiquant que ce n'était pas ça avant de se retourner et de pointer un doigt à l'horloge qui était suspendue sur le mur de la classe, au-dessus du tableau.

\textit{-L'horloge!} Une autre enfant dit et quand elle inclina la tête pour lui indiquer qu'elle était proche, une autre dit.

\textit{-Le temps.} Ce qui était la bonne réponse. Ensuite, elle agita sa main pour dessiner un demi-cercle en l'air.

\textit{-Un cerceau? Un ballon? Une fenêtre? La lettre "C"?} Elle continua à secouer la tête jusqu'à la dernière suggestion et indiqua que c'était ça. Puis, la fille leva trois doigts pour indiquer qu'elle allait mimer le dernier mot qui allait les aider à deviner. Elle leva la main et frotta son pouce contre son index et son majeur.

\textit{-Pincer ?} Cette réponse était fausse et elle secoua la tête.

\textit{-Monnaie?} Elle hocha la tête et fit un geste de la main pour leur indiquer de lui donner des synonymes du mot.

\textit{-Pièces? -Billets? -Argent !} La fille pointa du doigt le garçon qui avait deviné le mot \textit{Argent} et commença à sauter pour indiquer aux autres garçons que sa réponse était la bonne. Puis elle leva successivement son index suivi de son majeur et son annulaire, indiquant aux autres de se rappeler des trois mots.

\textit{-Temps, C, Argent...?} \textit{Le temps c'est de l'argent!} Emma s'écria. Sa mère utilisait toujours cet idiome pour inciter ses enfants à commencer à faire leurs devoirs, elle n'arrivait pas à croire qu'elle n'y avait pas pensé plus tôt.

\textit{-Oui! C'est exact!} \textit{Le temps c'est de l'argent} est un idiome traduit de l'Anglais qui signifie que bien employer son temps engendre un profit. Elle expliqua avec un grand sourire avant de retourner s'asseoir à sa place.

Emma pensa que cet idiome était son préféré et pas parce qu'elle avait réussi à le deviner correctement, mais à cause des efforts de la fille pour leur faire deviner l'idiome de manière amusante.

L'élève suivant qui était monté au tableau dessina un triangle avec une fraise au-dessus.

\textit{-Celui-ci est trop facile!} Dit l'un de ses camarades.

\textit{-On pourrait même dire que c'est du gâteau !} Un de ses amis compléta. Les deux garçons qui avaient dit ceci se tapèrent la main avec un sourire complice.

Et après leurs mots, il n'y avait aucun besoin d'expliquer l'expression et Emma pensa qu'en effet, c'était quelque chose de facile à deviner bien qu'elle doutait du fait que l'expression \textit{Du gâteau} pouvait être considérée comme un idiome. Maintenant, elle devait passer au tableau à son tour.

Elle prit un souffle avant de monter et elle se contenta de mettre un serre-tête avec des oreilles de chat, tout simplement, pour représenter son idiome. Son déguisement n'était rien de sophistiqué mais elle pensait que l'idiome qu'elle avait choisi était un peu difficile à deviner et elle était très excitée.

\textit{-Avoir un chat dans la gorge?} Dit un garçon qui s'asseyait d'habitude derrière elle et elle secoua sa tête, ce n'était pas ça.

\textit{-Appeler un chat un chat?} L'une des filles dit en inclinant sa tête sur le côté.

\textit{-Non,} dit-elle en baillant. Elle ne voulait pas donner plus d'indices que ça, sinon ça serait trop clair.

\textit{-La nuit, tous les chats sont gris.}

\textit{-Incorrecte.} Dit-elle en faisant semblant de s'endormir. Elle ne savait même pas ce que la dernière suggestion d'idiome signifiait.

\textit{-Oh! N'éveillez pas le chat qui dort !} L'un des garçons devina enfin et elle hocha la tête.

\textit{-On dit "Ne réveillez pas le chat qui dort." Pour dire de ne pas invoquer des histoires anciennes qui pourraient causer des problèmes.} Dit-elle en enlevant son serre-tête avant de reprendre sa place. Elle s'était bien amusée. Elle était un peu stressée au début mais après, ça avait passé.

L'idiome suivant était présenté par deux garçons qui se tenaient la main et qui regardaient droit devant eux. Ils semblaient marcher avec maladresse ou du moins, ils prétendaient marcher maladroitement.

\textit{-Voici un indice: On ne peut rien voir.} Dit l'un des deux garçons et attendit que ses camarades devinent l'idiome en question.

\textit{-Au royaume des aveugles, les borgnes sont rois?}

\textit{-Non. Essaye encore une fois.}

\textit{-Avoir des yeux pour ne rien voir?} Emma dit en faisant une petite grimace. Bien qu'elle savait que l'idiome voulait dire faire comme si de rien n'était, elle le trouva bizarre.

Les deux garçons rigolèrent. \textit{-Elle est bonne, celle-là! Mais, non.}

\textit{-Un aveugle sans bâton ?} Un garçon suggéra avec un sourire.

\textit{-Oh, pas mal! Mais ce n'est pas ça non plus.} L'un des garçons lui dit.

\textit{-Un aveugle qui en conduit un autre!} Lily, la meilleure amie d'Emma devina.

\textit{-Oui!} Les garçons l'applaudirent. Dire de quelqu'un que c'est un aveugle qui en conduit un autre signifie que cette personne est aussi impudente ou ignorante que celle qu'elle dirige. Les garçons sourirent à leurs camarades avant de retourner s'asseoir.

Les enfants continuèrent ainsi jusqu'à ce qu'il soit temps pour eux de rentrer chez eux. Leur enseignant les remercia et leur dit qu'il était fier d'eux et les informa qu'il allait y avoir un vote le jour suivant pour l'idiome le plus amusant. Emma ne pensait pas qu'elle allait gagner mais ce n'était pas important car elle s'était beaucoup amusée!

(French) (Reading Comprehension Exercise) D G (With Answer)

Toby était très excité d'accompagner son père dehors. Les deux allaient au marché pour acheter des légumes puis au supermarché pour faire les courses. Malgré que ces tâches n'avaient rien d'excitant, le petit garçon était heureux. C'était la première fois où il sortait pour faire ce genre de shopping, d'habitude il sortait avec ses parents pour acheter des vêtements ou des jouets mais jamais pour acheter de la nourriture. Il se demanda si son père lui permettrait d'acheter beaucoup de gâteries...

Une fois qu'ils arrivèrent au marché, le petit garçon sauta pratiquement hors de la voiture avant que son père ne put quitter son siège. Toby courut en avant et en se rappelant de son père, il s'arrêta brusquement. Il se retourna et regarda son père fermer la voiture avant de se tourner pour le regarder.

\textit{-Ne cours pas, mon grand. Tu risques de tomber et de te faire mal!} Son père marcha vers lui et prit sa main. \textit{Et ensuite, on va se faire gronder.} Il fit un clin d'œil à son fils avec un sourire. Toby rigola joyeusement. Le prospect de se faire gronder avec son père le rendit heureux et il pensa que cela le rendrait plus proche de son père. Comme des camarades qui auraient désobéi aux ordres et qui se feraient réprimander par leur supérieur. Mais, sa mère était plus belle qu'un supérieur en armée, bien évidemment!

Le petit garçon était plein d'enthousiasme en voyant les tables pleines de fruits et légumes colorés. Des tomates rouges vif, des cerises et des poivrons. Des pommes vertes, des brocolis, des asperges. Des oranges, des citrouilles, des aubergines, des myrtilles, des pommes de terre et des melons. Il y avait tous les légumes qu'il connaissait et même certains qu'il ne connaissait pas.

Certaines parties du marché étaient même dédiées aux poissons, épices, haricots et herbes. Lui et son père firent leur chemin à travers cet endroit en achetant ce qui était marqué dans leur liste de courses puis retournèrent à la voiture et mirent leurs sacs de légumes dans la malle.

Le supermarché était beaucoup moins excitant. Les produits étaient simplement présentés sur des étagères dans de différentes allées. Il n'y avait pas de tables avec des vendeurs qui bavardaient et riaient avec les clients mais il y avait quelques employés qui offraient des échantillons de dégustation de tartelettes et de sauces au fromage et d'autres produits du genre.

Toby était content d'y être cependant, car son père lui avait permis de choisir la marque des céréales et lui avait même acheté une barre de chocolat comme récompense pour être resté sage. Quand ils retournèrent à la maison, ils passèrent par une vente de garage que leur voisin tenait et encore une fois, Toby était intrigué par les gens qui s'étaient rassemblés autour des tables sur lesquelles différents objets étaient présentés.

Quand son père expliqua qu'une vente de garage était un moyen de se faire un peu d'argent et de se débarrasser des objets dont on n'a plus besoin, le petit garçon eut une idée. L'après-midi, quand Toby rencontra ses amis dehors, il leur parla de son idée.

\textit{-On devrait tenir un marché. On peut vendre des gâteries que nos mamans prépareraient ou des objets que l'on n'utilise plus.}

\textit{-Quels types d'objets?} Un de ses amis lui demanda.

\textit{-Des jouets. Des livres de coloriage. N'importe quel objet que tu n'utilises plus.} Il expliqua.

\textit{-Qui les achèterait? Je ne crois pas que les adultes voudront des jouets et les enfants n'ont pas beaucoup d'argent. Certains n'ont même pas d'argent de poche.} Une autre amie lui dit.

\textit{-On peut simplement faire des échanges. Si l'un de vous aime quelque chose que l'autre vend, il peut échanger avec lui un autre objet.} Toby dit ayant déjà pensé au manque d'argent.

\textit{-Les adultes n'achèteront peut-être pas de jouets mais ils achèteront des biscuits et du jus. Mon grand frère vendait de la limonade l'été dernier et il s'est fait assez d'argent pour acheter un nouveau téléphone.}

\textit{-Je pense que c'est une bonne idée. J'ai toujours voulu avoir un magasin de bouquins quand je serais grand et maintenant je peux commencer à m'entraîner.} Un autre enfant dit. Les autres enfants bavardèrent avec enthousiasme et ils étaient tous excités par leur petit projet.

\textit{-On doit demander la permission des adultes, par contre.} Toby dit. \textit{Et pas que nos parents, on doit voir si les voisins n'auront pas d'inconvénients.}

\textit{-Qu'est-ce qu'on va faire avec l'argent?} On lui demanda par la suite. Toby n'y avait pas pensé. Il était vrai qu'ils n'avaient besoin de rien puisque leurs parents prenaient soin de leur acheter tout ce dont ils avaient besoin et il pensa que leurs parents n'approuveraient pas qu'ils utilisent l'argent pour s'acheter des bonbons ou des jeux. Il savait que les adultes leur disaient toujours de ne pas gaspiller l'argent.

\textit{-On pourrait en faire un don aux enfants malades dans les hôpitaux.} L'un des garçons dit en haussant les épaules. \textit{N'est-ce pas ce que les scouts font quand ils vendent leurs biscuits? Ils font des dons et ils utilisent l'argent pour leurs programmes d'école, pas vrai?} Les enfants se mirent tous d'accord sur ce point et ils pensèrent tous que ça allait les aider pour convaincre leurs parents et le reste du quartier.

Les enfants se mirent d'accord et demandèrent la permission à leurs parents quand ils rentrèrent chez eux. Le jour suivant, ils se divisèrent et rendirent visite à leurs voisins pour demander leur permission pour établir leur petit marché de quartier et personne ne protesta. Certains offrirent même de préparer des gâteries pour qu'ils les vendent.

\textit{-Mme. Jordan fait le meilleur pain aux bananes! Ça va se vendre en un rien de temps.} Toby dit avec un grand sourire. Les enfants rassemblèrent les objets dont ils n'avaient plus besoin: des livres d'histoires, des livres de coloriage, des jouets, des affaires scolaires et même des vêtements. Certains avaient demandé à leurs parents de leur faire des gâteaux et certains préparèrent du jus tandis que d'autres préparèrent simplement des sandwiches et les voisins comme Mme. Jordan participèrent également en préparant de la nourriture ou en leur donnant des tables et des parasols pour le marché.

Le marché n'était pas trop large, juste trois tables qui avaient été installées dans l'aire de jeux du quartier et les enfants en étaient en charge. Toby échangea sa voiture télécommandée contre un beau T-shirt et l'une des filles acheta ses feutres en couleur. Les enfants qui vendaient de la nourriture offrirent des échantillons de dégustations et les adultes achetèrent du jus et des gâteaux pour eux et leurs enfants et tout le monde s'amusa. À la fin de la journée, l'argent qui avait été gagné fut compté et mit dans une grande enveloppe qui avait les noms de tous les enfants qui avaient organisé la vente écrits sur elle et ils l'envoyèrent au programme de charité pour enfants de l'hôpital.

(French) (Reading Comprehension Exercise) D G (With Answer)

Carter regardait avec grande fascination une image qui l'avait toujours intéressé dans son livre d'histoire. C'était une illustration colorée d'une tortue qui portait une île sur sa carapace et qui nageait dans l'océan. L'histoire était sur l'amitié que la tortue avait formée avec les humains qui vivaient sur l'île qu'elle portait pendant des générations, mais ce qui captura l'attention du petit garçon était le concept d'une île mouvante.

\textit{-Je me demande ce que ça ferait de vivre là-bas...} pensa-t-il. Son esprit voyagea dans un bateau où le capitaine était son imagination et il commença à rêvasser sur comment ça serait d'être l'un des habitants de l'île tortue. La première chose qui croisa son esprit était l'effet du mouvement de l'île sur ses habitants.

\textit{-Je me demande si on peut avoir le mal de mer ici...} dit-il en marchant à travers le village. Tout le monde parut en bon état et il ne sentit pas de nausée ou de vertige lui-même et il en conclut que non, les gens n'avaient pas le mal de mer sur l'île tortue. En explorant un peu partout, il vit de différents arbres et plantes. Il était confus pour un moment avant qu'il n'entendit une petite fille dire à son père qu'elle n'arrivait pas à attendre jusqu'à ce que le bananier portera ses fruits.

\textit{-Soit patiente, quand l'île est sur la bonne position, ça arrivera.} Son père lui avait répondu avec un sourire. Carter se rappela soudainement de ce qu'il avait appris à l'école et pensa que c'était génial que l'île puisse avoir tant de variété grâce aux climats des régions par lesquelles elle passait.

\textit{-Je parie qu'il y a aussi de différents types de poissons dans le marché à travers l'année.} Se dit-il à haute voix.

\textit{-C'est correct !} Une fille lui dit avec un fier sourire. \textit{Pas que ça, on ramène aussi de différents types de viande et de pâtes des pays par lesquels on passe.}

\textit{-C'est super !} Carter dit avant d'étendre sa main pour serrer la sienne.

\textit{-Je suis Carter.} Se présenta-t-il.

\textit{-Elena. Ravie de faire ta connaissance, Carter.}

\textit{-Moi aussi !}

\textit{-Tu veux aller voir la galerie des souvenirs ?} Elena offrit.

\textit{-C'est quoi ?}

\textit{-C'est un endroit où de différents objets que l'on a achetés de différents pays sont gardés. Généralement des objets provenant de pays côtiers puisque l'île ne peut pas s'arrêter assez longtemps pour nous permettre de visiter les autres pays des continents.} Elena expliqua avec un sourire.

\textit{-Ça paraît génial.}

Après toi ! Carter dit, excité à l'idée de voir ce qu'il y avait dans la galerie. Le premier objet qu'Elena lui montra était une statue en céramique d'un chat qui avait une patte levée.

\textit{Ceci s'appelle Maneki-neko. Le chat de chance japonais !} Lui dit-elle. \textit{On l'a clairement ramené du Japon. Les gens là-bas pensent qu'il apporte de la chance à son propriétaire.}

\textit{-Cool !} Carter dit en regardant le chat. Il était aussi très mignon.

Elena l'emmena ensuite à une table où un service à thé en céramique était posé. Il y avait une théière et des tasses de couleur blanche avec des motifs en bleu. Carter pensa que le service avait l'air très élégant et il imagina qu'un roi l'utiliserait pour boire son thé.

\textit{ Ceci vient de la Russie. Ça s'appelle Gzhel et ça prend son nom du village Russe où c'est fabriqué.} Elena lui dit.

Carter prit un moment pour admirer les dessins élaborés des motifs qui étaient peints sur la théière avant de passer à l'article suivant. C'était un objet très curieux. Ça semblait être un plat profond en argile avec un couvercle en forme de cône. C'était d'une belle couleur moutarde avec des motifs marrons, rouges et noirs peints dessus.

\textit{Qu'est-ce que c'est ?} Demanda-t-il curieusement.

\textit{Ceci est un plat Tajine. Ça vient du Maroc et c'est utilisé pour cuisiner des Tajines qui sont des plats riches à base de légumes et de viande d'agneau avec une délicieuse sauce.} Elena se lécha les lèvres en se rappelant du Tajine qu'elle avait mangé quand l'île était passée par le Maroc.

Quand ils avancèrent à travers la galerie, Elena montra à Carter un magnifique vase provenant de la Grèce avec une scène de la mythologie grecque peinte dessus. Elle lui montra aussi des objets en céramique provenant de l'Italie, de l'Espagne, du Brésil, de la Chine, et de divers autres pays.

\textit{Ils sont tous très beaux, mais est-ce qu'il y a seulement des pots et des vases dans la galerie ?} Demanda-t-il curieusement.

Elena rigola. \textit{Bien sûr que non, petit génie ! Cette partie est dédiée aux céramiques. La galerie est immense !} Lui dit-elle, en jetant ses bras en l'air pour indiquer à quel point l'endroit était vaste.

\textit{Viens, allons voir la partie des habits !} Et sur ce, elle le mena à une autre section à travers une porte. L'endroit était drapé de robes et de tenues de différentes couleurs et Carter lâcha un petit sifflement d'émerveillement. Il regarda l'habit soyeux qui était suspendu sur le mur à sa droite. C'était magnifique avec des couleurs pâles et de très jolis motifs.

\textit{C'est un Yukata. Magnifique, n'est-ce pas ?} Elena dit avec un regard rêveur. \textit{J'en ai un chez moi qui m'a été offert par une fille que j'ai rencontrée au Japon. Mais, pas aussi joli que celui-là. Ça reste très beau, par contre !}

\textit{Est-ce que celui-ci est pour hommes ?} Demanda-t-il en indiquant une version beaucoup plus simple de couleurs bleu nuit et gris foncé.

Elena hocha la tête et le mena en avant pour voir des vêtements provenant d'autres pays : des Saris venant d'Inde, des Kilts venant d'Écosse, des Agbada du Nigéria et beaucoup d'autres. Carter était très impressionné par tout ce qu'il avait vu et pas seulement à cause de la beauté des articles qui étaient dans la galerie, mais aussi par les cultures que chaque objet reflétait.

L'île tortue était bien plus qu'un endroit où les fruits et les poissons provenant de différentes régions du monde se trouvaient, c'était aussi un bateau géant permettant à tous ceux qui y étaient de voyager à travers le monde, de rencontrer des gens de nationalités différentes et d'apprendre leurs cultures et même leurs langues.

Quand son père frappa à sa porte pour lui demander ce qu'il était en train de faire, Carter sortit de son île imaginaire.

\textit{-Pas grand-chose.} Il répondit.

\textit{Papa ?} Dit-il par la suite.

\textit{-Oui ?} Son père entra dans sa chambre.

\textit{-Est-ce que tu penses qu'il serait facile d'écrire un livre d'histoire illustré ?} Carter demanda. Il avait une très bonne idée.

(French) (Reading Comprehension Exercise) D G (With Answer)

Jennie, Marshall et Ophelia se rassemblèrent au centre de la maison. Chaque fin de semaine, ils incitaient leur mère à sortir avec ses amies et à se détendre pendant qu'ils nettoyaient la maison avec l'aide de leur père et sous sa surveillance.

\textit{-Alors voilà, puisqu'on est à court de certaines choses, Papa est sorti acheter ce dont on a besoin mais on peut quand même diviser les tâches maintenant.} Ophelia, l'aînée, dit sur un ton enfantin mais ferme. Son frère et sa sœur hochèrent la tête en accord et attendirent qu'elle délégua leurs tâches.

\textit{-Comme d'habitude, Papa va s'occuper des cuvettes, fenêtres et miroirs.} Elle commença. \textit{Jennie, tu as fait la vaisselle la semaine passée, donc Marshall va faire cela cette semaine.} Dit-elle à sa sœur. \textit{Tu vas passer l'aspirateur au salon et au couloir tandis que je m'occupe du linge et je vais aussi faire le parterre de la cuisine. Est-ce que tout le monde a compris?} Encore une fois, les enfants les plus jeunes hochèrent leurs têtes.

À peine un moment plus tard, leur père ouvrit la porte et ils se dirigèrent tous vers la cuisine pour leurs nouveaux produits de nettoyage. Marshall prit une paire de gants et une bouteille de savon à vaisselle.

\textit{-Est-ce que je peux aussi remplacer la vieille éponge? Elle est devenue dégueulasse.} Il demanda à son père qui hocha la tête.

\textit{-Je vais aussi changer la brosse des toilettes. Il est bien de changer les outils fréquemment, plus ils deviennent usés plus ils contiennent de bactéries.} Son père dit en prenant deux flacons vaporisateurs, une brosse, une paire de gants et un masque qui le protégerait des produits chimiques qui étaient dans les produits de nettoyage. Jennie, qui était chargée de passer l'aspirateur, prit également un des masques pour se protéger de la poussière.

Et quand tout le monde avait ce dont ils avaient besoin, ils se tapèrent les mains et se mirent au travail.

\textit{-Allez, les enfants. Montrons à Maman comment le nettoyage professionnel se fait!} Leur père dit. Le seul qui resta dans la cuisine était Marshall vu qu'il était celui qui allait faire la vaisselle. La première chose qu'il fit était de porter le tablier à froufrous de sa mère vu que celui de son père était trop grand pour lui. Il tourna et rigola en voyant le tablier se bouffer autour de lui. Puis, il glissa ses mains dans les gants en caoutchouc et remplit la cuvette d'eau avant d'ajouter le savon à vaisselle.

Il agita ses mains dans l'eau jusqu'à ce qu'elle devienne mousseuse et pleine de bulles et il s'amusa à faire de petites formes avec la mousse et à souffler sur les bulles. Il commença à chantonner le générique de son dessin animé préféré et se mit à frotter les plats sales, s'assurant que chaque tâche était partie. Ce serait dommage si sa mère devait les laver une deuxième fois s'il ne faisait pas son travail proprement.

De l'autre côté du mur qui séparait la cuisine du salon, Jennie avait commencé par faire un peu d'ordre. Elle aimait prétendre qu'elle était en mission urgente et donc, elle régla un minuteur sur le téléphone de son père et hocha sa tête avant de commencer. Elle ramassa les objets qui étaient sur son chemin, comme la couverture qui était sur le fauteuil et la bouteille d'eau qui était sur la table basse, et les mit à part avant d'essuyer la poussière qui était sur les meubles.

\textit{-La voie est libre!} Annonça-t-elle au salon vide. \textit{Initialisation de la partie deux de la mission.} Dit-elle après avoir déterminé que rien ne serait sur son chemin. Puis, elle mit l'aspirateur en marche et commença par le tapis. À chaque fois qu'elle finissait de nettoyer une partie du salon, elle disait: \textit{La voie est sûre!}

Dans la salle de bain, Ophelia tria le linge sale et sépara les vêtements colorés des blancs. Elle aimait empiler les vêtements colorés dans l'ordre de leur apparition dans l'arc-en-ciel et elle empila les vêtements blancs en commençant par ceux les moins purs à ceux qui étaient aussi blancs que de la neige.

Elle remplit le bouchon de détergent et le mit dans le compartiment correspondant de la machine à laver après s'être assurée qu'elle avait bien mesuré. Cela lui donna l'impression d'être une chimiste, et elle commença à mettre les vêtements dans la machine. Elle appuya sur quelques boutons et le cycle de lavage se lança.

Le père de famille allait de chambre en chambre, nettoyant les fenêtres et les miroirs. La chambre de Marshall n'avait que le miroir qui était monté sur son armoire et une seule fenêtre, et donc il commença par elle, vu qu'elle était la plus facile à nettoyer. Et si quelqu'un lui avait demandé quelle pièce était la plus difficile, il aurait dit que c'était le salon avec ses fenêtres qui allaient du sol au plafond.

Il était impatient de voir ses enfants grandir pour qu'ils puissent l'aider à les nettoyer. Pour l'instant, c'était lui et sa femme qui s'en occupaient, vu que c'était trop dangereux pour les enfants de monter sur des chaises pour arriver aux parties les plus hautes et il se pourrait que l'un d'eux perde son équilibre et tombe.

Quand les vêtements avaient fini leur cycle de lavage et firent un tour dans le sèche-linge, Marshall avait fini de faire la vaisselle et les membres de la famille firent une rotation dans les chambres. Papa alla à la salle de bain pour nettoyer les cuvettes, Ophelia alla à la cuisine pour faire le parterre et Marshall alla dans sa chambre pour organiser son bureau et ranger ses jouets.

Jennie, d'autre part, était en train de passer l'aspirateur dans la chambre de ses parents. Tous les enfants avaient trouvé un moyen de s'amuser en faisant leurs tâches et l'idée de rendre leur mère fière et heureuse les poussa à travailler dur.

Quand tout le monde avait fini ses corvées, leur père les emmena déjeuner dehors. \textit{-C'est plus juste ainsi. Nous aussi on a le droit de manger dans un restaurant élégant, n'est-ce pas?} Il leur dit en rigolant. Ils savourèrent tous leurs plats et retournèrent chez eux. Comme chaque week-end, leur mère exprima sa joie et son appréciation de leur travail et leur considération avant de leur donner des cadeaux qu'elle leur avait ramenés de sa sortie. Certains étaient des pâtisseries, d'autres étaient des breloques mais tout le monde était d'accord que le meilleur cadeau était l'expression de fierté dans les yeux de leur mère quand elle vit la maison briller de propreté.

(Spanish) (Grammar Exercise, Translation Exercise) D G (Exercise on dialogue completion)

What verbs do you use most in English? More or less, these same words correspond to their frequency of use in Spanish: to be (Ser/Estar*); to go (Ir/Irse*); to be able (can) (Poder); to work (Trabajar); to speak (Hablar); to say (Decir); to have (Tener/Tomar/Haber*); to give (Dar/Pasar*); to learn (Aprender); to do/make (Hacer). Some of these words have more than one choice in Spanish, because Spanish is more expressive. There are different shades of meaning for the English word we use, and hence more than one word. I would also like you to choose three extra verbs that you will need to use daily as part of your personal lifestyle. Personally, I would choose: to write (Escribir), to teach (Enseñar); to prepare (Preparar). After this, write down 10 nouns that are also indispensable to your daily conversation in English. I would choose: message (Mensaje); list (Lista); instructions (Instrucciones); water (Agua); color (Color); book (Libro); toy (Juguete); mommy (Mami); coffee (Café); room (Habitación).

Fill in the Spanish translation of the following simple sentences, which use the words I've chosen. Then make similar sentences using the words you yourself chose, in the space provided.

(Spanish) (Reading Exercise) D G (Exercise with comprehension questions)

Ariana y sus amigas finalmente llegaron al centro comercial y ellas no pueden contener su emoción. Ellas ven que el centro comercial está muy decorado. En todos lados hay muchas personas. Hay muchísimas personas. Hay niños, adultos e incluso mascotas. Rocío, una de las amigas de Ariana, sabe muy bien que quiere comprar. Ella quiere comprar un vestido largo. El vestido que ella quiere comprar cuesta más de 200 dólares pero hoy día, debido a los descuentos, ese vestido ahora cuesta sólo 50 dólares. Por ello, Rocío va a la tienda de ropa lo más rápido que puede. En realidad, ella corre hacia la tienda. Ariana y Fabiana tienen que seguirla si no quieren quedarse solas. Cuando Rocío llega a la tienda, ella ve que hay muchas personas dentro de la tienda de ropa. Ella no sabe qué hacer. Ella ve el vestido que quiere. El vestido que ella quiere viene en varios colores. ¿Cuál color le quedará mejor? Para saber qué color le queda mejor, ella se prueba todos los vestidos que hay disponibles. Fabiana y Ariana se quedan sentadas esperándola afuera de los probadores. Ellas no pueden creer cuánto tiempo le toma a Rocío decidirse por un color de vestido. Al final, ella no sabe qué color escoger y le pregunta a sus amigas. ¿Qué es lo que ellas dicen? Ellas le dicen que ella debe comprar el vestido de color azul. A ella le encanta la idea y se lo compra. Ahora sólo falta pagar por el vestido. Felizmente, Rocío tiene su tarjeta de crédito. Si ella usa su tarjeta de crédito, ella tendrá incluso más descuentos disponibles. Ariana quiere comprar un cargador de celular. ¿Dónde puede conseguir un cargador de celular? En la tienda de electrónicos, ¡por supuesto! Como Fabiana también quiere comprar unos nuevos audífonos, ella decide ir con ella. ¿Qué hay de Rocío? Ella no quiere ir porque piensa que ir a la tienda de electrónicos es muy aburrido. Por ello, Rocío se queda tomando un café cerca de la tienda de ropa. Ariana encuentra el cargador que quiere, pero desafortunadamente, ese cargador no tiene ningún descuento. Lo bueno es que ella al menos no necesitará gastar mucho dinero ya que ese cargador no está tan caro. Fabiana, por su parte, va a buscar los audífonos que ella quiere comprar. Ella vio los audífonos que quiere comprar en televisión. Son muy caros pero ella piensa que ahora de seguro el precio habrá bajado debido a los descuentos. Fabiana estaba en lo cierto. ¡Los audífonos que ella quiere comprar no cuestan casi nada! Fabiana no lo piensa mucho y los compra de inmediato. La única persona que no compra nada es Ariana. A pesar de que el cargador de celular que ella encontró es barato, ella no lo quiere comprar porque no tiene suficiente dinero. Lo bueno de tener amigas es que, a veces, ellas te ayudan si tú necesitas algo. En este caso, Ariana necesitaba dinero para comprar el cargador y sus amigas quieren ayudarla a comprárselo. Fabiana y Rocío dan a Ariana el dinero que necesita para comprar el cargador y ella les agradece. Al final, todos salen del centro comercial muy contentos.

Now that you have read the story, try to answer the following questions.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item ¿Qué es lo primero que Ariana y sus amigas notan al llegar al centro comercial?
    \item ¿Qué es lo que Rocío quiere comprar?
    \item ¿Por qué Rocío se toma mucho tiempo en los cambiadores?
    \item ¿Cuánto cuesta ahora el vestido que Rocío quiere comprarse?
    \item ¿De qué color es el vestido que Rocío compra?
    \item ¿Cómo paga Rocío?
    \item ¿Qué es lo que Ariana quiere comprar?
    \item ¿Qué es lo que Fabiana quiere comprar?
    \item ¿A qué tienda Ariana y Fabiana van para comprar lo que ellas quieren?
    \item ¿Por qué Rocío no quiere ir a la tienda de electrónicos?

(German) (Grammar Exercise) D G (Exercise on changing articles, With answer)

Change the definite article of each noun to the indefinite article.\\

For example, when presented with the word der Vater, you would say ein Vater to change to the indefinite article.

\begin{enumerate}
\item der Lehrer (teacher) \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
\item die Schauspielerin (actress) \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

(German) (Reading Exercise, Comprehension Exercise) D G (With Answer, Exercise with a separate translation)

Es war einmal ein armer Mann, der in einem Dorf wohnte. Dieser Mann war sehr arm, aber er besaß ein Pferd, das so exquisit war, das selbst Könige es ihm abkaufen wollten-  und das zu jedem Preis. Doch der Mann lehnte immer wieder ab. Plötzlich eines Morgens, stellte er fest, dass das Pferd verschwunden war. Alle Menschen aus dem Dorf versammelten um ihr Mitgefühl auszudrücken.\\

Sie sagten: "Oh, was für ein Unglück, was hättest du für ein Vermögen mit diesem Pferd verdienen können und man hat dir so viel dafür geboten! Aber du warst zu dickköpfig und zu dumm. Jetzt ist das Pferd weg. "\\

Aber der alte Mann lachte nur und sagte: "Ach redet doch keinen Unsinn: "Alles was man darüber sagen kann, ist, dass das Pferd jetzt nicht mehr in seinem Stall ist. Lass die Zukunft kommen und uns zeigen was passiert"\\

Nach wenigen Tagen kehrte das Pferd plötzlich zurück in seinen Stall. Nicht nur das, es brachte eine ganze Herde wilder Pferde aus dem Wald mit. Und wieder versammelte sich das ganze Dorf und sie sagten: "Unglaublich, der alte Mann hatte Recht sein Pferd ist tatsächlich zurückgekommen, und es hat auch noch ein ganzes dutzend toller Pferde mitgebracht. Jetzt kann er so viel Geld verdienen, wie er will." Und sie gingen zu dem alten Mann und sagten: "Oh es tut uns Leid wir konnten das ja nicht voraussehen und die Wege Gottes verstehen, aber du bist unglaublich. Du hast es wohl irgendwie geahnt. Vielleicht kannst du sogar die Zukunft voraussehen."\\

"So ein Quatsch." sagte der alte Mann nur. "Ich weiß nur, eins: Nämlich, dass das Pferd mit einer ganzen Herde Pferde zurückgekommen ist und was morgen geschehen wird, das weiß nur der liebe Gott."\\

Und schon ein paar Tage später geschah es, das der einzige Sohn des Mannes, der die neuen Pferde zureiten wollte, dabei vom Pferd fiel. Er brach sich dabei seine Beine so schwer, das er fortan wohl nicht mehr würde richtig laufen können. Die Menschen kamen wieder zu dem alten Mann und sagten: "Du hast recht gehabt. Man weiß nie. Die Sache mit den Pferden hat sich als ein Fluch erwiesen. Da wäre es besser gewesen, wären die Pferde überhaupt gar nicht erst gekommen. Nun wird dein Sohn für sein ganzes Leben lang verkrüppelt sein.\\

Aber der alte Mann sagte wieder nur: "Nicht so voreilig. Wartet ab! Man wird sehen was geschieht. Man kann nämlich nur eines darüber sagen, nämlich, dass mein Sohn sich die Beine gebrochen hat. Das ist alles."\\

Einige Wochen später ergab es sich das in dem Land ein Krieg ausbrach und alle die jungen Männer des Dorfes von der Regierung zwangsweise eingezogen wurden. Nur der Sohn des alten Mannes durfte zu Hause bleiben, weil er für den Krieg untauglich war.\\

Und wieder versammelten sich alle Menschen des Dorfes und klagten: "Unsere Söhne sind fort und du hast wenigstens noch deinen Sohn. Er mag zwar seine Beine gebrochen haben, aber er ist bei dir. Unsere Söhne sind fort und der Feind ist vielleicht viel mächtiger. Wahrscheinlich werden sie alle sterben. Jetzt werden wir niemanden haben, der sich im Alter um uns kümmert. Aber du hast ja noch deinen Sohn. Er wird bestimmt wieder gesund.\\

Doch der alte Mann sagte wieder nur: "Man kann darüber nur eins sagen: Eure Söhne wurden eingezogen. Mein Sohn ist hier geblieben. Daraus folgt jedoch gar nichts.\\

\item Wie viele Pferde hatte der Mann am Anfang?
\item Mit wem lebte der Mann?
\item Wer kam immer zu dem Mann, um seine Situation zu beurteilen?
\item Was geschah als das Pferd wieder kam?
\item Was passierte mit dem Sohn des Mannes?
\item Was sagen die Bewohner des Dorfes über die Pferde, nachdem sich der Sohn verletzt hat?

\subsection*{Translation}
Once upon a time, there was a poor man who lived in a village. This man was very poor, but he owned a horse so exquisite that even kings wanted to buy it from him—at any price. Yet, the man repeatedly refused. One morning, he suddenly discovered that the horse was gone. All the villagers gathered to express their sympathy.\\

They said: “Oh, what bad luck! You could have earned a fortune with that horse, and so many had offered you so much for it! But you were too stubborn and too foolish. Now the horse is gone.”\\

But the old man just laughed and said: “Oh, stop talking nonsense. All that can be said about this is that the horse is no longer in its stable. Let the future come and show us what will happen.”\\

A few days later, the horse suddenly returned to its stable. Not only that, but it brought with it an entire herd of wild horses from the forest. Once again, the whole village gathered, and they said: “Unbelievable! The old man was right—his horse actually came back, and it even brought a dozen fine horses with it. Now he can earn as much money as he wants.” They went to the old man and said: “Oh, we are sorry; we could not foresee this or understand God’s ways. But you are incredible. You must have had some inkling. Maybe you can even see the future.”\\

“Nonsense,” said the old man. “I only know one thing: the horse came back with a whole herd of horses. What will happen tomorrow is known only to God.”\\

And just a few days later, it happened that the man’s only son, who was trying to tame the new horses, fell off one of them. He broke his legs so badly that he would likely never be able to walk properly again. The people came to the old man once more and said: “You were right. One never knows. This business with the horses turned out to be a curse. It would have been better if the horses had never come at all. Now your son will be crippled for the rest of his life.”\\

But the old man again said: “Don’t be so quick to judge. Wait and see! All that can be said is that my son broke his legs. That’s all.”\\

A few weeks later, a war broke out in the land, and all the young men of the village were forcibly conscripted by the government. Only the old man’s son was allowed to stay home because he was unfit for war.\\

Once again, all the villagers gathered and lamented: “Our sons are gone, but at least you still have your son. He may have broken his legs, but he is here with you. Our sons are gone, and the enemy may be far more powerful. They will probably all die. Now we will have no one to care for us in our old age. But you still have your son. He will surely recover.”\\

But the old man once again said: “There is only one thing that can be said: your sons were conscripted. My son stayed here. That’s all. Nothing follows from this.”\\

(German) (Reading Exercise, Comprehension Exercise) D G (With Answer)

Ein erfolgreicher Geschäftsmann wurde älter und erkannte, dass jemand ihn ersetzen sollte. Anstatt einige seiner Kollegen oder jemanden aus seiner Familie auszuwählen, entschied er sich, etwas Ungewöhnliches zu tun. Er lud alle potenziellen Kandidaten, Finanzdirektoren, Abteilungsleiter, Kassierer, Berater, ein und gab ihnen die folgende Rede:\\
\textit{One successful businessman was getting older and realized that someone should replace him. Instead of choosing some of his colleagues or someone from his family, he decided to do something unusual. He invited all potential candidates, financial directors, chiefs of departments, cashiers, and advisors and gave them the following speech:}\\

"Liebe Freunde, es ist Zeit für mich, mein Geschäft zu beenden und in einen verdienten Ruhestand zu gehen. Außerdem ist es jetzt die beste Zeit, einen neuen Geschäftsführer auszuwählen, der unser Unternehmen in Zukunft leiten wird ... Ich habe mich entschieden, dass es einer von euch sein wird. "\\
\textit{"Dear friends, it's time for me to finish my business and go to a deserved retirement. Also, now is the best time to choose a new general manager who will lead our company in the future. I decided that it would be one of you."}\\

Die jungen potenziellen Chefs waren verwirrt ...\\
\textit{The young prospective bosses were confused ...}\\

"Ich werde jedem von euch einen Samen geben. Dies ist ein ganz besonderer Samen. Ich will, dass ihr ihn alle pflanzt und gießt, und nächstes Jahr wieder zurückbringt, um zu sehen, was ihr damit gemacht habt. Dann werde ich entscheiden, wer der neue Geschäftsführer sein wird. "\\
\textit{"I will give each of you one seed. This is a very special seed. I want all of you to plant it and water it and we will gather again next year to see what you did with it. Then I will decide who will be the new manager. "}\\

Jim war auch bei diesem Treffen dabei, und wie auch alle anderen die anwesend waren, bekam er einen Samen. Als er nach Hause kam, teilte er die Nachricht mit seiner Frau und sie beschlossen, den Samen zu nähren, aus dem die Pflanze wachsen würde. Sie fanden einen schönen Topf, legten den Dünger und einen Thermometer ein, haben ein paar Bücher über Pflanzenanbau gelesen und fuhren mit ihrem Leben fort. Jeden Tag gingen sie zu dem Topf und warteten gespannt darauf, dass etwas auftaucht.\\
\textit{Jim was also at this meeting, and as everyone else present, he got the seed, too. When he arrived home, he shared the message with his wife and they decided to nurture the seed from which the plant would grow. They found a nice pot, put the fertilizer, took a thermometer, read a few books on plant cultivation, and continued with their lives. Every day they went to the pot and eagerly waited for something to emerge.}\\ 

Nach 14 Tagen haben einige von Jims Kollegen bereits angefangen, über ihre wachsenden Pflanzen zu sprechen. Und Jim beobachtete den Topf jeden Tag mit seiner Frau, aber nichts passierte. Es ist über ein Monat vergangen und nichts ist passiert. Über die Pflanzen wurde schon viel diskutiert.\\ 
\textit{After 14 days, some of Jim's colleagues had already started talking about their growing plants. And Jim watched with his wife every day, but nothing happened. It had been over a month and nothing happened. There had already been a lot of discussion about the plants.}\\ 

Zur Mittagszeit tauschten sie praktische Ideen über schnellen Wachstum aus, und Jim erkannte, dass er als einziger keinen Erfolg hatte.\\ 
\textit{At lunch-time, they exchanged practical ideas of rapid growth, and Jim realized that he was alone with nothing and that he was unsuccessful.}\\ 

Sechs Monate später, und es gab immer noch keine Fortschritte. Er begann zu glauben, dass er einen Fehler gemacht hatte. Vielleicht zu viel Wasser oder schlechter Dünger oder etwas anderes, das er nicht erklären konnte. Er wusste, dass er sein Bestes gab und es tat ihm leid, dass er keine Ergebnisse hatte.\\ 
\textit{Six months later, and there was still no progress. He began to believe that he had made a mistake. Maybe too much water or bad fertilizer or something else that he could not explain. He knew he did the best he could and was sorry he had no results.}\\ 

Das Jahr ging bald zu Ende, und die jungen Bosse versammelten sich mit ihren Pflanzen, um den Geschäftsführer zu treffen. Jim sagte seiner Frau, dass er den leeren Topf nicht mitnehmen würde, aber sie schaffte es, ihn zu überreden, um den Manager zu erzählen, was passiert war. Er war sehr nervös.\\ 
\textit{The year soon came to an end, and the young bosses gathered together with their plants to meet the general manager. Jim told his wife that he would not take the empty pot, but she, however, managed to persuade him, telling him to tell the manager fairly what had happened. He was very nervous.}\\ 

Er dachte, dass dies der unangenehmste Moment für ihn im Leben sein wird. Trotzdem wusste sie, dass sie Recht hatte und war fest davon überzeugt, dass er nichts falsch gemacht hatte. Er nahm seinen Topf mit in den Besprechungsraum. Er sah wunderschöne Pflanzen auf dem Tisch. Sie waren alle groß und ausgewachsen.\\ 
\textit{He thought that this would be the most unpleasant moment for him in life. Still, she knew she was right and was firmly convinced that there was nothing he did wrong. He took his pot in the meeting room. He saw beautiful plants on the table. They were all big and fully grown.}\\ 

Er stellte seinen leeren Topf auf den Boden, während andere lachten. Als der Geschäftsführer ankam, schaute er durch alle Pflanzen und begrüßte die Kandidaten. Jim versuchte, so weit von ihm entfernt zu sein, damit er es nicht sehen würde.\\ 
\textit{He put his empty pot on the floor, while others were laughing. When the general manager arrived, he looked through all the plants and greeted the candidates. Jim tried to be as far away from him, so that he would not see it.}\\ 

"Wie schön!" sagte der Geschäftsführer. "Ich sehe, dass es jetzt nicht einfach sein wird, einen neuen Manager auszuwählen ..." Und in diesem Moment sah er den leeren Topf. Er hat den Vizepräsidenten gebeten, ihn zu nehmen und den Eigentümer zu ihm zu bringen. Jim trat heraus.\\ 
\textit{"How beautiful!" the general manager said. "I see that it will not be easy to pick a new manager now ..." And, at that moment, he saw the empty pot. He asked the vice president to take it and bring the owner to him. Jim stepped out.}\\ 

"Oh Gott ... Vielleicht werde ich jetzt rausgeschmissen", dachte er.\\ 
\textit{"Oh God ... Maybe I'll get kicked out of the company now," he thought.}\\ 

Als er kam, fragte ihn der Manager, was mit seinem Samen passierte. Und Jim war ganz ehrlich und er entschuldigte sich. Der Manager bat dann alle sich zu sitzen - außer Jim. Er sah sie an und sagte:\\ 
\textit{When he came, the general manager asked him what happened to his seed. And Jim was all honest and he apologized. The general manager then asked everyone to sit - except for Jim. He looked at them and said:}\\ 

"Jim, ich bin sehr stolz auf dich ... Jim ist der neue CEO der Firma!"\\ 
\textit{"Jim, I'm very proud of you. Jim is the new CEO of the company!"}\\ 

"Nun ... wie ist das möglich? Mein Topf ist leer ...", fragte Jim verwirrt.\\ 
\textit{"Well ... how is that possible? My pot is empty. " Jim asked confused.}\\ 

Der alte Manager erklärte: "Vor einem Jahr gab ich jedem von euch einen toten Samen. Es war unmöglich, dass etwas daraus wächst. Jeder von euch, der sah, dass nichts passierte, beschloss es durch gesunde Samen zu ersetzen. Jeder von euch - Außer Jim. Ihr alle habt mir Pflanzen und Blumen gebracht. Nur Jim war stolz auf das Versagen und hatte genug Mut und Ehrlichkeit, mir einen leeren Topf zu bringen. Ihr wolltet Erfolg - um jeden Preis, und Jims Ehrlichkeit war wichtiger als Erfolg. Deshalb ist er heute der CEO ... "\\ 
\textit{The old general manager explained: "One year ago I gave each of you a dead seed. It was impossible that something could grow out of it. Each of you, seeing nothing to grow, decided to replace it with healthy seeds. Each of you - except Jim. You all brought me plants and flowers. Only Jim was proud of the failure and had enough courage and honesty to bring me an empty seed. You all wanted success - at all cost, and Jim's honesty was more important than success. That is why he is the CEO today. "}

Es gab einmal zwei Brüder, die auf benachbarten Farmen lebten. \\
\textit{There were once two brothers who lived on neighbouring farms and they were starting a serious fight.} \\

Es war der erste große Streit seit vierzig Jahren, seit sie Seite an Seite lebten, Werkzeuge teilten und sich gegenseitig halfen. \\
\textit{It was the first big fight for forty years, as they lived side by side, sharing tools and helping each other.} \\

Und dann war die Bindung gebrochen. \\
\textit{And then the bond was broken.} \\

Alles begann mit einem kleinen Missverständnis, das zu einem großen Streit und unhöflichen Worten führte, gefolgt von Wochen im Schweigen. \\
\textit{It all started with a little misunderstanding that led to a big quarrel and rude words, followed by weeks of silence.} \\

Eines Morgens klopfte jemand an Johns Tür. \\
\textit{One morning, someone knocked on John’s door.} \\

Er öffnete sie und sah einen Mann mit einem Werkzeugkasten. \\
\textit{He opened it and saw a man with a tool-box.} \\

“Ich suche Arbeit”, sagte er. “Vielleicht kann ich hier auf deiner Farm Arbeit finden?” \\
\textit{“I’m looking for a job,” he said. “Maybe here on your farm I can find some work?”} \\

“Ja”, sagte der ältere Bruder. “Ich weiß, was du für mich tun könntest. \\
\textit{“Yes,” said the older brother. “I know what you could do for me.} \\

Siehst du das Haus auf der anderen Seite des Baches? \\
\textit{You see that house on the other side of the stream? }\\

Hier wohnt mein Nachbar; eigentlich ist er mein jüngerer Bruder. \\
\textit{This is where my neighbour lives - actually, my younger brother. }\\

Letzte Woche war eine Wiese zwischen uns, aber er hat etwas von dem Fluss her gegraben und jetzt, ist ein Bach zwischen uns. \\
\textit{Last week, there was a meadow between us, but he dug something from the river to here and now there is a stream between us. }\\

Er hat es gemacht, um mich wütend zu machen, aber ich werde mich jetzt rechen … \\
\textit{He did it to make me angry, but I’ll get back at him …} \\

Du siehst diesen Stamm neben der Scheune? \\
\textit{You see that trunk by the barn? }\\

Ich will, dass du einen zwei Meter langen Zaun baust, damit ich ihn und sein Haus nicht mehr sehen kann.” \\
\textit{I want you to make me a two-meter-long fence so I cannot even see him or his house anymore.” }\\

Der Mann sagte: “Ich verstehe alles. Geben Sie mir Nagel und Bohrer und ich werde eien tolle Arbeit machen.” \\
\textit{The man said, “I understand everything. Give me a nail and a drill and I will do a great job.”} \\

Der ältere Bruder musste in die Stadt gehen, also gab er dem Mann das nötige Material und ging weg. \\
\textit{The older brother had to go to the city, so he gave the carpenter the necessary material and left.} \\

(German) (Reading Comprehension Exercise) D G (With Answer)

Zu Beginn des Schuljahres rief der Direktor einer Grundschule drei Lehrer an, und teilte ihnen mit, dass sie im letzten Schuljahr die besten Lehrer waren. \\
\textit{At the beginning of the school year, the director of one primary school called three teachers and informed them that they were the best teachers in the last school year. }\\

Er sagte ihnen dann, dass sie im nächsten Schuljahr drei Abteilungen unterrichten sollten, die aus 90 der intelligentesten Schüler bestehen. \\
\textit{He then told them that in the next school year they should teach three departments that consist of 90 of the most intelligent students.} \\

Aber er sagte ihnen, dass es eine Bedingung gäbe, und diese ist, dass sie ihren Schülern nichts sagen dürfen, damit sie ihre Eltern oder die Eltern von Kindern aus anderen Abteilungen nicht stören. \\
\textit{But he told them that there was one condition, and that was to say nothing to their students, so they would not disturb their parents or the parents of children from other departments. }\\

Das Schuljahr begann und kamm zu einem Ende. \\
\textit{The school year started and finished.} \\

Am Ende des Jahres war die Durchschnittsnote für Schüler dieser drei Klassen viel besser als für andere Klassen in ihrer Schule, und sogar 20 bis 30\% ihres Erfolges waren besser als der Durchschnitt aller Schulen in der Gegend. \\
\textit{At the end of the year, the average grade for students from these three classes was much better than other classes in their school, and even 20 to 30\% of their success was better than the average of all schools in the area.} \\

Als der Direktor die Lehrer fragte, was sie darüber dachten, wie sie es geschafft hatten, sagten sie ihm, dass dies eine wundervolle Erfahrung für sie sei, dass ihre Arbeit jedoch dadurch erleichtert wurde, dass sie begabte und erfolgreiche Schüler unterrichteten. \\
\textit{When the director asked the teachers what they thought about it and how they achieved it, they told him that this had been a wonderful experience for them, but that their work was made easier by the fact that they taught gifted and successful students.} \\

Der Direktor sagte zu ihnen: “Lassen Sie mich Ihnen die wahre Wahrheit sagen: Sie waren weder begabt noch besonders intelligente Schüler, wie wir Ihnen am Anfang sagten, sondern wählten zufällig 90 Schüler aus, die wir in diesen drei Abteilungen eingesetzt haben. \\
\textit{The director told them: “Let me tell you the true truth: Those were not gifted, nor especially intelligent students, as we told you at the beginning, but a randomly selected 90 students that we deployed into those three departments that you taught.} \\

Die Lehrer waren verwirrt: “Haben wir zum Erfolg des Schülers beigetragen?” \\
\textit{The teachers were confused: “Well, did we contribute to the students’ success?” }\\

Der Direktor sagte ihnen: “Nun lassen Sie mich Ihnen eine andere Wahrheit sagen - ich wählte sie, indem ich die Namen aller Lehrer in der Schule auf ein Blatt Papier schrieb, und dann zeigte ich mit meinem Finger auf drei Namen - das waren eure Namen.” \\
\textit{The director told them, “Now let me admit to you another truth - I chose you by writing the names of all teachers in the school on a sheet of paper, and then I pointed my finger at three names - these were your names.”} \\

“Also, was ist der Grund?” fragten sie. \\
\textit{“So what’s the reason?” They asked.} \\

“Der Grund dafür war es, dass ihr zunächst den Standpunkt vertretet habt, dass ihr erfolgreich sein werdet, basierend auf die Information die euch dazu gebracht hat, so zu denken; also habt ihr das Ergebnis erreicht, auch wenn diese Information nicht korrekt war. Ich wollte euch zeigen, dass ihr das Ergebnis dessen seid, was ihr denkt und glaubt.” \\
\textit{“The reason is that you initially had the stance that you will achieve success based on the information that led you to expect extraordinary success, so you have achieved the result, regardless of the fact that this information was incorrect. I wanted to show you that you are the result of what you think and what you are hoping for.”} \\

Die Lehrer waren beeindruckt und dankbar für die Lektion, die sie gelernt haben. \\

(German) (Reading Comprehension Exercise) D G (With Answer)

Ich habe vor zwanzig Jahren als Taxifahrer gearbeitet. Einmal, mitten in der Nacht, kam ich nach einem Anruf zu einem Gebäude, das völlig im Dunkeln lag, bis auf ein Licht aus dem Fenster im Erdgeschoss.\\
\textit{I worked as a taxi driver twenty years ago. Once, in the middle of the night, I arrived at a call in a building that was completely in the dark except for one light from the window on the ground floor.}\\

Unter diesen Umständen würden viele Taxifahrer das Hupe nur ein- oder zweimal benutzen, eine Minute warten und dann losfahren. Aber ich sah zu viele arme Leute, die auf Taxis als einzige Transportmittel angewiesen waren. Wenn ich die Gefahr in der Luft nicht riechen würde, würde ich immer zur Tür gehen. Ein Passagier könnte jemand sein, der meine Hilfe braucht, dachte ich. Also, ging ich zur Tür und klopfte.\\
\textit{Under these circumstances, many taxi drivers would use the horn only once or twice, wait a minute and then drive off. But I saw too many poor people who were dependent on taxis as their only means of transport. If I did not smell the danger in the air, I would always go to the door. A passenger could be someone who needs my help, I thought. So I went to the door and knocked.}\\

"Einen Augenblick", sagte eine brüchige, ältere Stimme. Ich hörte etwas auf dem Boden ziehen. Die Tür öffnete sich nach einer langen Pause. Vor mir stand eine kleine Frau in ihren Achtzigern. Sie trug ein Kleid mit einem Muster und einen Hut, an dem der Schleier befestigt war, wie jemand in einem Film aus den 40ern. Neben ihr war ein kleiner Koffer.\\
\textit{"Just a moment," said a brittle, older voice. I heard something pulling on the floor. The door opened after a long pause. In front of me was a small woman in her eighties. She wore a dress with a pattern and a hat on which the veil was attached, like someone from a 40's movie. Next to her was a small suitcase.}\\

Die Wohnung sah aus, als wäre sie jahrelang leer gestanden. Alle Möbel waren mit Laken bedeckt. Es gab keine Uhren an den Wänden, keine kleinen Dinge oder Geschirr auf der Theke. In der Ecke stand eine Pappschachtel voller Fotos und Glaswaren.\\
\textit{The apartment looked like no one had lived in it for years. All the furniture was covered with sheets. There were no clocks on the walls, no small things or dishes on the counter. In the corner was a cardboard box full of photographs and glassware.}\\

"Würden Sie bitte meine Tasche zum Auto bringen" sagte sie. Ich nahm den Koffer zum Taxi, und dann kam ich zurück, um der Frau zu helfen. Sie nahm meine Hand und ging langsam zum Rand des Bürgersteigs. Sie dankte mir weiterhin für meine Freundlichkeit. \\
\textit{"Would you please take my bag to the car," she said. I took the suitcase to the taxi, and then I came back to help the woman. She took my hand and we walked slowly towards the edge of the sidewalk. She kept on thanking me for my kindness. }\\

"Oh, nichts zu danken", sagte ich ihr. "Ich versuche nur meine Passagiere so zu behandeln, wie ich möchte, dass andere meine Mutter behandeln." \\
\textit{"Oh, no need to thank me," I told her. "I'm just trying to treat my passengers as I would like others to treat my mother."} \\

"Oh, du bist so ein guter Junge", sagte sie. Als wir das Taxi betraten, gab sie mir die Adresse und dann fragte sie mich: "Können wir durch die Innenstadt fahren?" \\
\textit{"Oh, you are such a good boy," she said. When we entered the cab, she gave me the address and then she asked me, "Could we go through the city center?" }\\

"Es ist nicht der kürzeste Weg", antwortete ich schnell. \\
\textit{"It's not the shortest way," I replied quickly.} \\

"Das macht nichts", sagte sie. "Ich habe es nicht eilig. Ich bin auf dem Weg ins Krankenhaus." \\
\textit{"It does not matter," she said. "I'm not in a hurry. I'm on my way to the hospital."} \\

Ich schaute in den Spiegel. Ihre Augen glitzerten. \\
\textit{I looked in the mirror. Her eyes glittered. }\\

"Ich habe keine Familie mehr", fuhr sie fort. "Ärzte sagen, ich habe nicht mehr viel Zeit." \\
\textit{"I no longer have any family," she continued. "Doctors say I don't have a lot of time left."} \\

Ich beugte mich vor und drehte den Taxameter um. "Welchen Weg soll ich nehmen?", Fragte ich. \\
\textit{I leaned in and turned down the taximeter. "Which way would you like to go," I asked.} \\

Wir fuhren für die nächsten zwei Stunden durch die Stadt. Sie zeigte mir das Gebäude, in dem sie als Fahrstuhlführerin arbeitete. Wir gingen durch die Nachbarschaft, wo sie und ihr Ehemann lebten. Sie bat mich, vor einem Möbelgeschäft anzuhalten, das früher ein Tanzsalon war, in den sie als Mädchen ging. Manchmal bat sie mich gebeten, vor einem Gebäude oder einer Ecke abzubremsen, und sie saß da und schaute in die Dunkelheit, ohne etwas zu sagen. Als der erste Strahl der Sonne am Horizont erschien, sagte sie plötzlich: "Ich bin müde. Lass uns jetzt gehen."\\
\textit{We drove through the city for the next two hours. She showed me the building where she used to work as an elevator operator. We walked through the neighbourhood where she and her husband lived. She asked me to stop in front of a furniture store that used to be a dancing salon where she was going as a girl. Sometimes she would ask me to slow down in front of some building or corner, and she sat staring into the darkness, not saying anything. When the first rays of the sun began to appear on the horizon, she suddenly said: "I'm tired. Let's go now."}\\

Schweigend fuhren wir zu der Adresse, die sie mir gegeben hatte.\\
\textit{In silence we drove to the address she gave me.}\\

Es war ein kleines Gebäude. Als wir anhielten, kamen zwei Männer zum Taxi. Voller Aufmerksamkeit folgten sie jeder Bewegung. Sie müssen sie erwartet haben. Ich öffnete den Kofferraum und nahm den kleinen Koffer zur Tür. Die Frau saß schon im Rollstuhl.\\
\textit{It was a small building. Two men came to the taxi as soon as we stopped. Full of attention, they followed every movement. They must have expected her. I opened the trunk and took the small suitcase to the door. The woman was already sitting in a wheelchair.}\\

"Wie viel schulde ich dir?", Fragte sie und öffnete ihre Handtasche.\\
\textit{"How much do I owe you," she asked, opening her purse.}\\

"Nichts", antwortete ich.\\
\textit{"Nothing," I replied.} \\

"Du musst von etwas leben", antwortete sie. \\
\textit{"You must live from something," she replied.} \\

"Es gibt andere Passagiere." \\
\textit{"There are other passengers."} \\

Fast ohne nachzudenken, beugte ich mich vor und umarmte sie. \\
\textit{Almost without thinking, I leaned over and hugged her.} \\

"Du hast einer alten Frau einen glücklichen Moment geschenkt", sagte sie. "Danke." \\
\textit{"You gave an old woman one moment of happiness," she said. "Thank you."} \\

Ich drückte ihre Hand und ging in das neblige Morgenlicht. Hinter mir schloss sich die Tür. Es war der Klang des Endes eines Lebens. \\
\textit{I squeezed her hand and walked into the foggy morning light. Behind me, the door closed. It was the sound of the end of life.} \\

In dieser Schicht habe ich keine anderen Passagiere mitgenommen. Ich war in meinen Gedanken verloren. Und den Rest des Tages sprach ich kaum. Was wäre, wenn die Frau einen wütenden Fahrer bekommen hätte oder jemanden, der seine Schicht beenden wollte? Was, wenn ich mich geweigert hätte, sie mitzunehmen? Wenn ich darüber nachdenke, denke ich, dass es das Wichtigste ist, was ich in meinem Leben getan habe. Wir sind überzeugt, dass sich unser Leben um wichtige Momente dreht. Aber wichtige Momente treffen uns oft unvorbereitet - schön verpackt in etwas, das manche als unwichtig bezeichnen würden. \\
\textit{In that shift, I did not take any other passengers. I was lost in my thoughts. And the rest of that day, I barely spoke. What if the woman got an angry driver, or someone who was eager to finish the shift? What if I refused to take her? When I think about it, I think that's the most important thing I've done in my life. We are convinced that we think that our lives revolve around important moments. But important moments often take us unprepared - beautifully packaged in what some would call unimportant.}

(German) (Reading Comprehension Exercise) D G (With Answer, Multi-part)

In einer kleinen Stadt lebte eine junge Frau namens Julia Schmidt. Sie war sehr intelligent und talentiert. Da sie Sozialpädagogik studierte, war sie auf der Suche nach einem Job in einem Kindergarten. Julia liebte Kinder, und es war schon immer ihr Traumjob gewesen. Deswegen beschloss sie, ihre Bewerbung in einem kleinen Kindergarten abzugeben und dort ihr Glück zu versuchen. Als sie dort ankam, erwartete sie die Direktorin des Kindergartens und begrüßte sie.\\
\textit{In a small town lived a young woman named Julia Schmidt. She was very intelligent and talented. Since she was studying social education, she was looking for a job in a kindergarten. Julia loved children and it had always been her dream job. Therefore, she decided to submit her application in a small kindergarten and try her luck there. When she got there, the director of the kindergarten welcomed her.}\\

Julia war nervös, aber sie wollte den Job. Sie stellte sich vor und hat von ihrer Liebe für Kinder erzählt. Außerdem erwähnte sie, dass sie ein Praktikum abgeschlossen hat. Die Direktorin hörte Julia zu, aber am Ende sagte sie:\\
\textit{Julia was nervous, but she wanted the job. She introduced herself and told of her love for children. She also mentioned that she had completed an internship. The director listened to Julia, but in the end she said:}\\

``Liebe Frau Schmidt, sie sind sehr freundlich und alles was Sie mir heute erzählt haben ist wundervoll. Ich bin mir sicher, dass Sie eine gute Erzieherin sein würden. Ich kann Sie aber nicht einstellen. Es tut mir leid."\\
\textit{``Dear Mrs. Schmidt, you are very friendly and all you have told me today is wonderful. I'm sure you would be a good educator. I cannot hire you. I am sorry."}\\

Julia schaute die Frau nervös an.\\
\textit{Julia looked at the woman nervously.}\\

``Können Sie mir bitte sagen, warum Sie dies nicht machen können"?\\
\textit{``Can you please tell me why?"}\\

Die Direktorin antwortete:\\
\textit{The director replied:}\\

``Ich sehe nicht, dass Sie Erfahrung in diesem Job haben. Sie können von ihrer Liebe für Kinder reden, aber ich brauche etwas, was mir wirklich sagt, dass Sie für diese Position gut ausgebildet sind. Verstehen Sie mich nicht falsch und nehmen sie meine Worte nicht persönlich, aber Sie werden wahrscheinlich noch viel arbeiten, bevor Sie als eine kompetente Erzieherin arbeiten können. Ich könnte Sie als Betreuerin einstellen. Das bedeutet, dass Sie auf die Kinder während der Schlafenszeit aufpassen. Eine Erzieherin muss wissen, wie man mit Kindern umgeht und was sie tun dürfen und was nicht. Ich habe das Gefühl, dass Sie immer noch unreif für diese Position sind."\\
\textit{``I do not see that you have experience in this job. You can talk about your love for children, but I need something that really tells me that you are well educated for this position. Do not get me wrong and do not take my words personally, but you probably will work a lot more before you can work as a competent educator. I could hire you as a caregiver. This means that you take care of the children during bedtime. An educator needs to know how to deal with children and what they are allowed to do and what not. I feel like you are still immature for this position."}\\

Julia sah die Direktorin mit Enttäuschung an. Sie fühlte, dass sie mehr als bereit für solch einen Job ist. Für sie war dies ein sehr harter Schlag ins Gesicht.\\
\textit{Julia looked at the director with disappointment. She felt that she was more than ready for such a job. For her, this was a very hard slap in the face.}\\

``Frau Schmidt, es tut mir wirklich leid. Sie sind aber sehr jung. Sie haben noch ihr ganzes Leben vor sich und vielleicht bekommen Sie eines Tages diesen Job. Zurzeit ist dies aber unmöglich für Sie. Ich muss dieses Gespräch jetzt zu Ende bringen. Es sind noch andere Kandidaten hier. Viel Glück."\\
\textit{``Mrs. Schmidt, I'm really sorry. But you are very young. You still have a whole life and maybe one day you will get this job. At the moment this is impossible for you. I have to finish this conversation now. There are other candidates here. Good luck."}\\

``Ich verstehe. Danke für Ihre Zeit". Julia hob ihre Tasche auf und ging nach draußen. Sie stieg in den Bus und sie konnte ihre Gefühle nicht kontrollieren. Ihre Wangen waren voller Tränen. Sie fühlte sich gedemütigt und hatte keine Hoffnung mehr. Monate vergingen und sie wusste nicht, wie es weiter gehen soll. Außerdem gab es keine anderen Kindergärten, weil es nicht viele Bewohner in der Stadt gab."\\
\textit{I understand. Thank you for your time." Julia lifted her bag and went outside. She got on the bus and she could not control her feelings. Her cheeks were full of tears. She felt humiliated and had no hope. Months passed and she did not know what to do next. In addition, there were no other kindergartens because there were not many residents in the city.}\\

Eines Morgens ging Julia mit Ihrem Hund in den Park. Sie setzte sich auf eine Bank und nahm die Zeitungen aus der Tasche, die sie auf dem Weg gekauft hatte. Auf der ersten Seite sah sie ein Bild des Kindergartens, in dem sie sich beworben hat. In dem Artikel stand, dass die Direktorin den Kindergarten schließen muss, weil sie nicht genug Geld haben, um alles zu finanzieren. Die Erzieher haben schon seit zwei Monaten kein Gehalt bekommen und die Eltern der Kinder sind mit ihrer Arbeit unzufrieden.\\
\textit{One morning Julia went to the park with her dog. She sat down on a bench and took out the newspapers she had bought on the way. On the first page, she saw a picture of the kindergarten she had applied for. The article said that the director had to close the kindergarten because they did not have enough money to finance everything. The educators had not received a salary for two months and the parents of the children were dissatisfied with their work.}\\

Julia war geschockt. Sie wusste, dass sie etwas tun muss. Es handelt sich um Kinder, die Erziehung und Liebe brauchen. Julia ging nach Hause und beschloss, alle Sachen, von ihrem Auto bis hin zu den paar wertvollen Kleinigkeiten zu verkaufen. Das einzige was sie noch übrig hatte, war ihre Wohnung, die fast leer war.\\
\textit{Julia was shocked. She knew she had to do something. These were children who needed education and love. Julia went home and decided to sell everything from her car to the few precious little things she had. The only thing she had left was her apartment, which was almost empty.}\\

Danach ging sie in den Kindergarten und klopfte an die Tür der Direktorin.\\
\textit{Then she went to the kindergarten and knocked on the door of the director.}\\

``Guten Tag. Kann ich bitte mit Ihnen sprechen?"\\
\textit{``Good day. Can I speak with you, please?"}\\

Die Direktorin sah erschöpft aus und sah Julia nicht mal an.\\
\textit{The director looked exhausted and did not even look at Julia.}\\

``Seien Sie bitte schnell. Ich habe nicht sehr viel Zeit. Ich muss dieses Büro räumen." – sagte die Direktorin.\\
\textit{``Please be quick. I do not have much time. I have to leave this office", said the director.}\\

``Hier." Julia legte einen großen Stapel Geld auf den Tisch.\\
\textit{``Here." Julia put a big stack of money on the table.}\\

Die Direktorin drehte sich zu ihr und sah das Geld.\\
\textit{The director turned to her and saw the money.}\\

``Was ist das?" – fragte sie.\\
\textit{``What's that?" - she asked.}\\

``Ich möchte, dass Sie dieses Geld nehmen und die Kosten decken, die Sie haben. Es kann sicher für einige Monate ausreichen. Ich werde bis dann wieder einen Weg finden und dem Kindergarten helfen" – sagte Julia entschlossen.\\
\textit{``I want you to take this money and cover the costs you have. It can certainly be enough for a few months. I will find a way and help the kindergarten until then," said Julia, determined.}\\

Die Direktorin war geschockt. Ihr kamen sogar die Tränen.\\
\textit{The director was shocked. She even cried.}\\

``Wie habe ich das verdient? Ich habe Sie doch vor einigen Monaten abgelehnt und einige Sachen gesagt, die vielleicht zu grob waren."\\
\textit{``How did I deserve that? I refused you a few months ago and said some things that were perhaps too crude."}\\

``Das ist wahr. Aber mir sind die Kinder wichtig. Manche von ihnen brauchen diesen Kindergarten mehr, als es sie braucht. Deswegen kann ich es nicht zulassen, dass Sie ihn schließen. Geld sollte kein Problem darstellen. Wenn man Kinder liebevoll behandelt und mit ihnen gut umgeht, dann werden die Eltern auch zufrieden sein und weiterhin ihre Kinder in den Kindergarten schicken. Es ist nicht so kompliziert wie Sie denken."\\
\textit{``This is true. But the children are important to me. Some of them need this kindergarten more than it needs them. That's why I cannot let you close it. Money does not have to be a problem. If you treat children well and with love, then the parents will be satisfied and continue to send their children to the kindergarten. It's not as complicated as you think."}\\

Die Direktorin wusste, dass Julia recht hat. Sie sah sie an uns sagte: \\
\textit{The director knew that Julia was right. She looked at her and said:}\\

``Sie haben keine Ahnung, wie dankbar ich bin. Das einzige was ich für sie tun kann, ist sie zu bitten, hier mit mir zu arbeiten. Ich kann ihnen für den Anfang kein großes Gehalt versprechen, aber..."\\
\textit{``You have no idea how grateful I am. The only thing I can do for you is to ask you to work here with me. I cannot promise you a big salary for the beginning, but ..."}\\

Julia unterbrach die Direktorin:\\
\textit{Julia interrupted the director: }\\

``Geld ist mir unwichtig. Ich würde gerne hier arbeiten und ich verspreche Ihnen, dass Sie bald wieder aus dieser Situation herauskommen werden."\\
\textit{``Money is unimportant to me. I would like to work here and I promise you that you will get out of this situation soon."}\\

So bekam Julia ihren Traumjob. Ja, die ersten Monate waren hart, aber die Kinder liebten sie. Jeden Tag wuchs die Anzahl der neuen Kinder im Kindergarten und somit auch Julias Liebe für die Kinder.\\
\textit{This is how Julia got her dream job. Yes, the first months were tough, but the kids loved her. The number of new children in the kindergarten grew every day and so did Julia's love for the children.}

(German) (Reading Comprehension Exercise) D G (With Answer)

Henry und Lucas waren zwei Jungs, die nebeneinander lebten. Als sie noch kleine Kinder waren, haben sie ständig zusammen gespielt und man kann sagen, dass sie sogar beste Freunde waren. Ihre Familien haben sich gut verstanden und waren sehr gute Nachbarn. Doch als die Jungs älter wurden und sie in die Mittelschule gehen mussten, haben sich die Dinge ein bisschen geändert. Henry war ein sehr intelligenter Junge und hatte in der Schule immer gute Noten, während Lucas einige neue Freunde fand, und die Schule als echte Qual empfand. Er hasste die Lehrer und fing an sich schlecht zu benehmen. Für ihn waren seine Freunde und die Partys am wichtigsten.\\
\textit{Henry and Lucas were two boys living side by side. When they were little kids, they played together all the time and you could say they were even best friends. Their families got along well and were very good neighbours. But as the boys got older and they had to go to middle school, things had changed a bit. Henry was a very smart boy and always got good grades at school, while Lucas made some new friends and for him school was a real torture. He hated the teachers and started behaving badly. For him, his friends and parties were most important.}\\

Henry wusste, dass seine Mitschüler ihn nicht so sehr mogen. Die Lehrer liebten ihn aber. Dies war auch ein Grund, warum ihn seine Klassenkameraden ständig gemobbt haben. Sie machten Henry zum Aussenseiter. Die anderen würden ihm ständig neue Spitznamen geben und da Lucas seine Popularität nicht aufgeben wollte, hat er Henry auch schikaniert. Für Henry war dies aber kein Problem. Er wusste wer er ist und dass dies nicht seine Freunde waren. Er war ein wenig enttäuscht von Lucas, aber trotzdem hatte er seine Ziele im Kopf. Er wollte gut in der Schule sein und auch wenn ihn andere nicht akzeptierten, versuchte er ihnen bei Prüfungen zu helfen.\\
\textit{Henry knew his classmates did not like him so much. But the teachers loved him. That was one of the reasons his classmates bullied him constantly. They made Henry into a geek. The others would constantly give him new nicknames, and since Lucas did not want to give up his popularity, he bullied Henry as well. For Henry this was not a problem. He knew who he was and that these were not his friends. He was a little disappointed with Lucas, but still he had his goals in mind. He wanted to be good at school and even if others did not accept him, he tried to help them with exams.}\\

Eines Tages kamen sie in die Klasse und Lucas stand vor all seinen Klassenkameraden und sagte:\\
\textit{One day they came to class and Lucas stood in front of all his classmates and said:}\\

``Hey hört mal alle zu! Diesen Freitag habe ich das Haus für mich allein und ich mach eine große Party und ihr sollt alle kommen. Es wird der Hammer, wie immer!"\\
\textit{"Hey, listen everyone! I have the house for myself this Friday. I'll have a big party and you should all come. It will be awesome, as always!"}\\

Alle standen auf und gingen zu Lucas um sich über die Party zu freuen. Sie waren sehr aufgeregt und haben gelacht. Dann wollte Lucas noch etwas sagen:\\
\textit{Everyone got up and went to Lucas to talk about the party. They were very excited and laughed. Then Lucas wanted to say something else:}\\

``Ich habe mich nicht sehr gut ausgedrückt. Alle können kommen, außer Henry. Sorry Mann, aber ich habe nicht so viel Platz, du weißt schon, oder?" Er lachte und zwinkerte seinen Freunden zu.\\
\textit{"I did not express myself very well. Everyone can come, except for Henry. Sorry man, but I do not have that much space, you know, right?" He laughed and winked at his friends.}\\

Henry sah ihn für eine Sekunde an und drehte sich um, um seine Bücher rauszunehmen. Er war es schon gewohnt, dass keiner ihn zu Partys einladen wollte. Deswegen war er auch nicht überrascht. Alle lachten und haben ihn wieder gemobbt.\\
\textit{Henry looked at him for a second and turned to take out his books. He was used to not getting invited to parties. That's why he was not surprised. Everyone laughed and bullied him again.}\\

Der Tag der Party kam an und alle waren aufgeregt und freuten sich. Henry ging nach der Schule nach Hause und spielte Videospiele. Er konnte schon am Nachmittag die laute Musik hören, aber er versuchte, sie zu ignorieren. Es war eine große Party und das Haus war voll.\\
\textit{The day of the party arrived and everyone was excited and happy. Henry went home after school and played video games. He could hear the loud music in the afternoon, but he tried to ignore it. It was a big party and the house was full.}\\

In einem Moment, hörte Henry Schreie und laute Geräusche. Er stand aber nicht auf, denn er dachte, dass es nur laute Musik und Geschrei von der Party ist. Auf einmal hörte er aber etwas Merkwürdiges.\\
\textit{In one moment, Henry heard screams and loud noises. He did not get up because he thought it was just loud music and screaming from the party. Suddenly, he heard something strange.}\\

``Feuer!!!!!!! Oh mein Gott. Schnell!! Hilfeeee!!... FEUER!!" Diese Worte wiederholten sich ständig und alle haben geschrien.\\
\textit{"Fire!!!!!!! Oh my God. Fast!! Heeeelp !! ... FIRE !!" These words kept repeating and everyone was screaming.}\\

Henry ging aus seinem Haus und sah ein Feuer im zweiten Stock von Lucas` Haus. Er sah wie alle ängstlich aus dem Haus ängstlich rannten. Henry rief gleich die Feuerwehr gleich an. Alle waren draußen, doch er konnte Lucas nicht sehen.\\
\textit{Henry went out of his house and saw a fire on the second floor in Lucas's house. He saw how everyone in the house ran anxiously. Henry called the fire department immediately. Everyone was outside, but he could not see Lucas. }\\

``Lucas ist im Badezimmer eingeschlossen. Er kann nicht raus! Hilfeee! Jemand muss ihn rausholen" – rief ein Mädchen aus der Masse.\\
\textit{"Lucas is trapped in the bathroom. He cannot get out! Heeelp! Someone has to get him out,” a girl exclaimed from the crowd.}\\

Henrys Herz klopfte nie schneller. Er musste etwas tun. Henry rannte schnell zu dem Haus und ging rein. Alle waren geschockt und waren in Panik. Er ging die Treppe auf und konnte nicht leicht nur schwer atmen. Das Feuer hatte sich schon überall ausgebreitet. Er musste die Tür des Badezimmers aufbrechen und danach ging er rein. Er sah Lucas auf dem Boden. Lucas konnte kaum atmen. Henry hob ihn auf und versuchte Lucas aus dem Haus zu bringen. Es war sehr schwer aber er schaffte es bis zur Haustür. Alle waren geschockt als sie die beiden sahen. Zu dieser Zeit kam auch die Feuerwehr. Zum Glück konnten sie das Feuer schnell löschen. Ein Feuerwehrmann ging zu Henry und sagte:\\
\textit{Henry's heart never beat faster. He had to do something. Henry quickly ran to the house and went in. Everyone was shocked and in panic. He came upstairs and could not breathe easily. The fire was already everywhere. He had to break the door of the bathroom and then he went in. He saw Lucas on the floor. Lucas was breathing heavily. Henry lifted him and tried to get Lucas out of the house. It was very hard but he made it to the front door. Everyone was shocked when they saw them. At this time fire department arrived. Luckily they were able to extinguish the fire quickly. A fire-fighter went to Henry and said:}\\

``Du bist ein sehr mutiger Junge. Ein wahrer Held. Du warst der einzige, der mutig genug war, um deinem Freund das Leben zu retten.Du hast dein eigenes riskiert. Das ist unglaublich."\\
\textit{"You are a very brave boy. A true hero. You were the only one brave enough to save your friend's life. You risked your own. That's incredible." Henry antwortete: Henry replied:} \\

``Wir sind keine Freunde, aber wir sind Menschen. Ich würde jedem helfen."\\
\textit{"We are not friends, but we are human. I would help everyone. "}\\

Lucas war erschöpft aber er hat diese Worte gehört.\\
\textit{Lucas was exhausted but he heard those words.}\\

``Henry, ich... ich kann es nicht glauben. Du hast mich gerettet. Wie habe ich das verdient." - fragte Lucas.\\
\textit{"Henry, I ... I cannot believe it. You saved me. How did I earn that?" asked Lucas.}\\

``Du kennst mich Lucas. Auch wenn wir keine Freunde mehr sind, weist du immer noch, dass ich dir immer helfen würde." – antwortete Henry.\\
\textit{"You know me, Lucas. Even though we are no longer friends, you still know that I would always help you," replied Henry.}\\

``Danke.. ich fühle mich so schlecht. Ich und die anderen haben dich immer gemobbt. Das war falsch. Am Ende warst du der einzige, der mich aus dem Feuer geholt hat...Glaubst du, dass wir wieder Freunde sein können? Ich verspreche dir, dass ich dich nie wieder enttäuschen werde. Ich werde nie zulassen, dass dir irgendjemand etwas schlechtes sagt...bitte..ich vermisse meinen besten Freund..."\\
\textit{"Thanks ... I feel so bad. Me and the others have always bullied you. That was wrong. In the end, you were the only one who got me out of the fire. Do you think we can be friends again? I promise you that I will never disappoint you again. I'll never let anyone tell you something bad ... please...I miss my best friend ... "}\\

``Wir können es ja versuchen." – Henry zwinkerte und Lucas hatte wieder ein Lächeln auf seinem Gesicht.\\
\textit{"We can try it." Henry winked and Lucas had a smile on his face again.}\\

Und es war auch so. Sie wurden wieder beste Freunde und alle anderen liebten Henry. Sie respektierten ihn für seine Taten und Henry war sehr stolz darauf.\\
\textit{And it was like that. They became best friends again and everyone else loved Henry. They respected him for his actions and Henry was very proud of it.}

(Mathematics) (Word Problem Exercise, Explanation Exercise) D 6 (With Answer)
Ingrid says, "I can multiply by 100 by adding two zeros." Explain why Ingrid is wrong.

\subsection*{Answers}
Ingrid's statement is incorrect because simply adding two zeros to a number does not accurately represent multiplication by 100. For example, if you take the number 5.6 and add two zeros, you get 5.600, which is not the same as multiplying 5.6 by 100, which equals 560. This method only works for whole numbers and does not apply to decimal numbers or fractions.

Nasreen has a packet of coloured beads. The packet contains 5 orange beads, 5 red beads, and 10 blue beads. Nasreen says, "Half the beads are blue." She is correct. Explain how you know.

\subsection*{Answers}
To determine if Nasreen is correct, we first calculate the total number of beads:
\[
5 \text{ (orange)} + 5 \text{ (red)} + 10 \text{ (blue)} = 20 \text{ beads}.
\]
Next, we find half of the total number of beads:
\[
\frac{20}{2} = 10 \text{ beads}.
\]
Since there are 10 blue beads, which is half of the total, Nasreen is correct.

Hassan says, "I would rather have \( \frac{3}{8} \) of \$36 than \( \frac{1}{4} \) of \$60 because \( \frac{3}{8} \) is bigger than \( \frac{1}{4} \)." Do you agree with Hassan? Explain your answer.

\subsection*{Answers}
To determine whether you agree with Hassan, calculate \( \frac{3}{8} \) of \$36 and \( \frac{1}{4} \) of \$60.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( \frac{3}{8} \) of \$36 is \( \frac{3 \times 36}{8} = \$13.50 \)
    \item \( \frac{1}{4} \) of \$60 is \( \frac{1 \times 60}{4} = \$15.00 \)
\end{itemize}

Since \$13.50 is less than \$15.00, you may disagree with Hassan.

(Mathematics) (Word Problem, Problem-solving) D 5 (With Answer)

India has a bowl of fruit. \( \frac{1}{4} \) are apples, \( \frac{1}{3} \) are papayas, \( \frac{1}{6} \) are mangos, and the other fruit are bananas. Calculate the possible numbers of each fruit. Your answer should use a common denominator.

\subsection*{Answers}
Let the total number of fruits be \( x \). Then:
\begin{itemize}
\item Number of apples = \( \frac{1}{4}x \)
\item Number of papayas = \( \frac{1}{3}x \)
\item Number of mangos = \( \frac{1}{6}x \)
\item Number of bananas = \( x - \left(\frac{1}{4}x + \frac{1}{3}x + \frac{1}{6}x\right) \)
\end{itemize}

To find a common denominator, we can use 12:
\begin{itemize}
\item Number of apples = \( \frac{3}{12}x \)
\item Number of papayas = \( \frac{4}{12}x \)
\item Number of mangos = \( \frac{2}{12}x \)
\end{itemize}

Adding these fractions gives:
\[
\frac{3}{12}x + \frac{4}{12}x + \frac{2}{12}x = \frac{9}{12}x
\]
Thus, the number of bananas is:
\[
x - \frac{9}{12}x = \frac{3}{12}x = \frac{1}{4}x
\]

The total number of fruits must be a multiple of the least common multiple of the denominators (4, 3, and 6), which is 12. Therefore, possible values for \( x \) could be 12, 24, 36, etc.

(Mathematics) (Word Problem) D 6 (With Answer)

Jason sold \(\frac{3}{10}\) as many pens as Mike. If Jason sold 210 fewer pens than Mike, how many pens did they sell altogether?

\subsection*{Answers}
Let \( x \) be the number of pens Mike sold. Then, Jason sold \(\frac{3}{10}x\) pens. According to the problem, we have the equation:

\[
\frac{3}{10}x = x - 210
\]

Solving for \( x \):

\[
\frac{3}{10}x + 210 = x
\]
\[
210 = x - \frac{3}{10}x
\]
\[
210 = \frac{7}{10}x
\]
\[
x = 210 \times \frac{10}{7} = 300
\]

So, Mike sold 300 pens, and Jason sold:

\[
\frac{3}{10} \times 300 = 90
\]

Altogether, they sold:

\[
300 + 90 = 390 \text{ pens.}
\]

The ratio of the number of Cynthia's posters to the number of Laura's posters was \( 3 : 4 \). Cynthia had 24 fewer posters than Laura. Later, Laura gave 36 of her posters away to her brother. Find the new ratio of the number of Cynthia's posters to the number of Laura's posters.

\subsection*{Answers}
Let the number of Cynthia's posters be \( 3x \) and Laura's posters be \( 4x \). According to the problem, we have:
\[
3x = 4x - 24
\]
Solving for \( x \):
\[
x = 24
\]
Thus, Cynthia has \( 3 \times 24 = 72 \) posters and Laura has \( 4 \times 24 = 96 \) posters. After Laura gives away 36 posters, she has \( 96 - 36 = 60 \) posters. The new ratio of Cynthia's posters to Laura's posters is:
\[
\frac{72}{60} = \frac{12}{10} = \frac{6}{5}
\]
The new ratio is \( 6 : 5 \).
