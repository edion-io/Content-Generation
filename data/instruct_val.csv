Il était difficile de continuer à ignorer le chant des oiseaux et des criquets, l'aboiement du chien et le brouhaha des habitants de la maison.\\
Martin soupira avec regret, et éjecta sa couverture d'un coup de pied.\\
Il bailla et se frotta les yeux avant de quitter son lit.\\
Il jeta un coup d'œil à son réveil et grogna de mécontentement quand il remarqua qu'il s'était réveillé beaucoup plus tôt qu'il n'avait prévu.\\
\\
-- Et moi qui voulais faire la grasse matinée... marmonna-t-il.\\
\\
Il alla faire sa toilette et, avant de se brosser les dents, laissa échapper un sourire moqueur en voyant son reflet.\\
Ses cheveux étaient tout ébouriffés! Il avait même un peu de bave qui dégoulinait du bout de sa bouche.\\
Une fois propre, il se dirigea vers la cuisine pour prendre son petit déjeuner.\\
Il y avait une délicieuse odeur dans toute la maison et, même s'il ne savait pas de quoi il s'agissait, il en voulait une grosse part.\\
\\
En entrant, il entendit sa mère et son grand frère chuchoter puis les vit.\\
\\
-- J'ai économisé assez d'argent pendant les trois dernières années. N'oublie pas que je travaillais aussi pendant l'été, disait Lucas.\\
\\
Il avait la tête inclinée envers Maman et lui jetait un regard suppliant. Maman lui lança un regard douteux avant de retourner son attention vers la poêle.\\
Elle retourna une crêpe avant de poser sa spatule puis questionna Lucas:\\
\\
-- Mais est-ce que tu crois que ça va te suffire pour acheter une voiture? C'est plutôt cher comme engin tu sais...\\
\\
-- Oui! Une petite voiture d'occasion, je n'ai pas besoin d'une voiture neuve dès le début, répondit le grand frère.\\
\\
Lorsque sa mère ne dit rien, Lucas ajouta:\\
\\
-- S'il te plaît Maman, je viens d'avoir mon bac. Je ne vais quand même pas vous demander de me conduire à l'Université tous les jours lors de la rentrée! Et puis, ce n'est pas comme si vous deviez conduire Martin au collège non plus puisqu'il est en vacances. Papa a plus de temps libre maintenant.\\
\\
Maman laissa échapper un soupir puis sourit indulgemment:\\
\\
-- D'accord, je vais en parler à ton père, acquiesça-t-elle, mais la décision lui revient.\\
\\
Lucas hocha la tête avec un sourire et embrassa Maman sur la joue en la remerciant.\\
\\
-- C'est tout ce que je te demande, dit-il.\\
\\
Martin, se doutant de ce qui se passait, décida de confirmer ses soupçons.\\
\\
-- Qu'est-ce qu'il y a? demanda-t-il d'un ton nonchalant, en sortant une boîte de jus du réfrigérateur.\\
\\
-- Bonjour chéri, ton frère veut apprendre à conduire, répondit-elle.\\
\\
Papa avait accepté de donner des cours de conduite à Lucas. Tous les jours, ils sortaient l'après-midi, passaient environ deux heures dehors puis rentraient de mauvaise humeur. Papa et Lucas étaient clairement contrariés après les fameux cours de conduite et Martin se demanda ce qui pouvait bien se passer pour qu'ils soient aussi fâchés, ce qui le poussa à demander de les accompagner pour la prochaine leçon.\\
\\
-- Je m'ennuie, ça me tente de venir avec vous, dit-il en guise d'excuse pendant qu'ils dînaient. Même si ce n'est que pour un jour, ajouta-t-il.\\
\\
Lucas acquiesça d'un haussement d'épaules, et Martin vit Maman fixer lourdement Papa, le poussant à accepter sa demande.\\
\\
C'était décidé, Martin allait partir avec eux!\\
\\
Le lendemain, Martin s'installa sur la banquette arrière, et mit sa ceinture de sécurité.\\
Il observa silencieusement Papa s'asseoir à l'avant et Lucas au volant. Ce dernier ajusta son siège ainsi que les rétroviseurs avant de mettre le contact.\\
Environ une heure et demie après, le trio rentra à la maison.\\
Papa et Lucas étaient fâchés comme les derniers jours et Martin avait l'air pensif. Il avait compris la cause de leur conflit: Papa n'est pas un bon enseignant.\\
Il n'était pas du tout patient, et Lucas n'appréciait pas ses directives et commentaires dits sur un ton irrité.\\
\\
Ayant pitié de son grand frère, Martin décida de lui suggérer une solution d'une manière subtile.\\
\\
Il alla s'asseoir à côté de lui sur le canapé et laissa s'écouler quelques minutes avant de commencer à parler.\\
\\
-- Ce n'est pas vraiment simple de conduire avec Papa, hein? dit-il avec un sourire compatissant.\\
\\
-- Ouais, c'est le moins qu'on puisse dire..., répondit Lucas en levant les yeux au ciel.\\
\\
-- J'avais la même impression lorsqu'il m'apprenait les tables de multiplication au primaire, heureusement que j'avais réglé le problème rapidement.\\
\\
Lucas, intrigué par les paroles de son petit frère, se tortilla un peu avant de glisser un peu plus près de Martin.\\
Il s'éclaircit la gorge et demanda d'une voix basse:\\
\\
-- Et comment t'as fait?\\
\\
Martin le regarda d'un air complice et lui dit:\\
\\
-- J'ai demandé à Maman de le faire à sa place. Elle est beaucoup plus patiente et douce.\\
\\
Lucas lui lança un regard douteux puis fronça les sourcils.\\
\\
-- Je pense que Maman est trop occupée pour m'apprendre à conduire.\\
\\
-- Alors aides-la avec ses corvées, rétorqua Martin.\\
\\
Lucas hocha la tête mais ne dit rien.\\
Il y eut un long moment de silence avant que le frère aîné ne pinçât la joue de Martin, le remerciant pour son conseil.\\
\\
-- Lorsque j'aurai mon permis, je t'emmènerai au parc d'attraction chaque semaine! lui dit-il, excité.\\
\\
Martin s'en doutait mais il sourit quand même, ravi d'avoir pu aider son grand-frère.\\
\\
Quelques jours après, la paix et l'harmonie étaient de retour à la maison.\\
Lucas avait commencé à faire le linge et à laver la vaisselle, accordant plus de temps libre à Maman et par conséquent, plus de temps pour lui apprendre à conduire.\\
\\
Après le changement d'enseignants, Lucas fit beaucoup plus de progrès et s'inscrivit peu après pour passer son permis.\\
Au bout de quelques mois, la famille exprimait sa fierté tandis que Lucas les conduisait à un restaurant pour célébrer sa réussite.\\
\\
-- C'est grâce aux cours de conduite que je lui ai donnés, dit Papa avec un sourire orgueilleux.\\
\\
Les trois autres ne dirent rien mais levèrent les yeux au ciel. Enfin, tous sauf Lucas qui devait garder les yeux sur la route!

Give me a reading comprehension exercise for a student learning French. It should have a subsection for answers.,"Tôt le matin, Monsieur Adler entra dans la classe et salua ses élèves avec grande joie. Il aimait vraiment enseigner et jouer un rôle dans l'éducation des futurs dirigeants du monde. Il aimait leur apprendre de nouvelles choses et se réjouit de voir quand ils faisaient preuve d'avoir appris leurs leçons, que cela soit en utilisant de nouveaux mots qu'ils avaient appris ou par la résolution correcte d'une équation mathématique. \\

Étant quelqu'un qui passait la majorité de sa journée avec ces enfants, il connaissait bien ses petits apprentis et il savait que certaines leçons étaient plus à leurs goûts que d'autres. Par exemple, bien qu'ils aient aimé la session de lecture d'hier, il savait que la leçon de mathématiques d'aujourd'hui n'allait pas être reçue avec beaucoup d'enthousiasme. \\

Et, comme il avait deviné, la réaction des élèves variait de soupirs déçus à quelques plaintes que les mathématiques étaient ennuyeuses. M. Adler posa son menton sur sa main et réfléchit pendant quelques minutes. \\

Il regarda hors de la fenêtre et fit une grimace en voyant la pluie. Les enfants n'allaient pas pouvoir sortir dehors pour la récréation et il ne voulait pas que leurs humeurs deviennent pires en étudiant quelque chose qui ne les amusait pas, en plus du fait de ne pas pouvoir sortir pour jouer. \\

Il voulait que l'école soit un endroit amusant pour eux et il décida de faire preuve de compassion. Il pourrait retarder la leçon d'une heure environ. \\

\textit{-Bon, d'accord. Alors, que dites-vous de ceci :} il commença en se penchant sur son bureau. \textit{Et si vous jouez le rôle d'enseignant pour cette session ?} \\

Les enfants se regardèrent en confusion avant de tourner leur attention sur lui et lui demander ce qu'il voulait dire par ça. \\

\textit{-Eh bien, je veux que chacun de vous nous enseigne quelque chose. Vous allez avoir cinq minutes chacun pour nous enseigner ce que vous voulez. Juste un petit truc simple que vous savez faire.} \\

\textit{-Ohhh ! C'est beaucoup plus intéressant que d'additionner des nombres !} l'un des enfants dit, poussant les autres à parler en même temps pour exprimer leur accord avec lui. \\

\textit{-Allons, les enfants.} M. Adler les calma. \textit{Nous allons quand même avoir notre cours de maths après.} Il les informa avec un regard ferme mais pas cruel. \textit{Vous avez dix minutes pour penser à un sujet, utilisez votre temps avec sagesse.} \\

Les enfants tournèrent leur attention vers leurs cahiers et commencèrent à écrire des notes et des étapes sur différents sujets. Chacun d'eux avait pris la tâche très sérieusement et lorsque leurs dix minutes s'étaient écoulées, ils avaient tous fini leurs petits plans de leçons. \\

La première personne qui était montée au tableau était une petite fille. Elle demanda à l'enseignant de lui donner un marqueur avant de dire à ses camarades qu'elle allait leur apprendre comment dessiner un ours en peluche. \\

\textit{-Tout d'abord, vous devez dessiner un grand cercle avec un cercle plus petit sur lui en haut. C'est le corps et la tête de l'ours en peluche.} Elle expliqua en dessinant les cercles en question. \\

\textit{-Vous pouvez dessiner avec moi si vous voulez.} dit-elle par-dessus son épaule. \\

\textit{-Puis, dessinez deux demi-cercles en haut sur les côtés du cercle du haut. Ce sont les oreilles. Deux petits cercles en bas des deux côtés du grand cercle, qui sont les pieds.} Elle continua à dessiner pour leur montrer et quelques-uns des enfants dessinaient avec elle sur leurs cahiers. \\

\textit{-Pour dessiner les bras, faites deux ellipses sur les côtés du corps, dessinez-les à moitié à l'intérieur du grand cercle pour faire en sorte que l'ourson tienne son ventre.} M. Adler dût s'empêcher de rire. \\

Lucy, la fillette qui était en train de donner sa leçon, était adorable et il était très fier d'elle. \\

\textit{-Maintenant, donnons des yeux et une bouche à l'ourson. Dessinez un cercle sur la partie inférieure de la tête et un autre plus petit sur lui en haut pour faire le nez. Dessinez une ligne qui descend du nez et pour dessiner la bouche, dessinez un numéro trois allongé sur son dos comme ça !} \\

M. Adler devait avouer que son élève avait dessiné un ourson en peluche très mignon sur le tableau et il pouvait clairement voir que les autres élèves avaient aimé la leçon. \\

\textit{-Merci beaucoup, Lucy,} dit-il en l'applaudissant, ce qui poussa les autres enfants à l'applaudir aussi. \\

L'enfant suivant qui devait enseigner les autres était un garçon nommé Colin. \\

\textit{-Je vais vous apprendre comment faire un avion en papier et comment le faire voler très haut.} Il commença ensuite à plier une feuille qu'il avait emmenée avec lui au tableau. \\

Quand il avait enfin fini de la former en avion, il démontra le geste correct de sa main pour le lancer. \\

\textit{-Merci, Colin. Tes camarades ont l'air d'avoir beaucoup aimé ta leçon,} M. Adler lui dit avec amusement en regardant les enfants lancer les avions en papier haut dans l'air. \\

Après cela, une fille monta et déclara qu'elle allait apprendre à ses camarades comment faire une tresse. \\

\textit{-Je vais avoir besoin d'un volontaire. Katie, tes cheveux sont longs, tu veux bien venir et me laisser les tresser pour montrer aux autres ?} \\

Et c'était ainsi qu'une heure et demie se déroula. Les enfants avaient chacun un talent intéressant à enseigner. L'un d'eux avait utilisé ses lacets pour leur montrer comment faire des nœuds de marin, une autre apprit à ses camarades comment utiliser les mots ""Quand"" et ""Quant"" correctement, ce qui avait beaucoup impressionné M. Adler. \\

Et il y avait même un enfant qui avait montré aux autres comment faire leurs cartes de fête des mères eux-mêmes. \\

Quand tout le monde eut son tour, l'enseignant se leva et s'éloigna de son bureau. \\

\textit{-Merci beaucoup, tout le monde. J'ai appris beaucoup de choses et je suis sûr que c'est le cas pour vous aussi,} dit-il. \\

\textit{-Lequel avez-vous préféré, Monsieur Adler ?} un garçon lui demanda. \\

\textit{-Aucun. J'ai aimé toutes les leçons de manière égale,} répondit-il, préférant rester neutre. \\

\textit{-Et maintenant que nous nous sommes bien amusés, il est temps d'apprendre à additionner des nombres !} leur dit-il de manière taquine, en répétant les mots de son élève. \\

Les enfants laissèrent échapper un grognement collectif mais il était content de voir qu'ils étaient tous de meilleure humeur.

\textit{At the beginning of the school year, the director of one primary school called three teachers and informed them that they were the best teachers in the last school year. }\\

Er sagte ihnen dann, dass sie im nächsten Schuljahr drei Abteilungen unterrichten sollten, die aus 90 der intelligentesten Schüler bestehen. \\
\textit{He then told them that in the next school year they should teach three departments that consist of 90 of the most intelligent students.} \\

Aber er sagte ihnen, dass es eine Bedingung gäbe, und diese ist, dass sie ihren Schülern nichts sagen dürfen, damit sie ihre Eltern oder die Eltern von Kindern aus anderen Abteilungen nicht stören. \\
\textit{But he told them that there was one condition, and that was to say nothing to their students, so they would not disturb their parents or the parents of children from other departments. }\\

Das Schuljahr begann und kamm zu einem Ende. \\

Am Ende des Jahres war die Durchschnittsnote für Schüler dieser drei Klassen viel besser als für andere Klassen in ihrer Schule, und sogar 20 bis 30\% ihres Erfolges waren besser als der Durchschnitt aller Schulen in der Gegend. \\
\textit{At the end of the year, the average grade for students from these three classes was much better than other classes in their school, and even 20 to 30\% of their success was better than the average of all schools in the area.} \\

Als der Direktor die Lehrer fragte, was sie darüber dachten, wie sie es geschafft hatten, sagten sie ihm, dass dies eine wundervolle Erfahrung für sie sei, dass ihre Arbeit jedoch dadurch erleichtert wurde, dass sie begabte und erfolgreiche Schüler unterrichteten. \\
\textit{When the director asked the teachers what they thought about it and how they achieved it, they told him that this had been a wonderful experience for them, but that their work was made easier by the fact that they taught gifted and successful students.} \\

Give me a reading comprehension exercise for a student learning French. It should have a subsection for answers.,"Lily leva la tête vers le ciel et ronronna de contentement lorsqu'elle sentit la chaleur des rayons du soleil lui envelopper le corps.\\
Elle se leva lentement de sa position allongée et s'étira. Samedi était le jour favori de la chatonne car sa propriétaire, Sarah, passait presque toute la journée à la maison.\\
Elle en prenait soin, la chouchoutait et lui donnait plein de gâteries. Ce samedi était particulièrement agréable car on pouvait clairement sentir l'arrivée du printemps.\\

-- C'était une bonne sieste, dit-elle distraitement en se dirigeant vers sa fontaine à eau dans le couloir.\\

Elle jeta un coup d'œil à sa gamelle de croquettes et fut ravie de voir qu'elle était pleine.\\
Elle lapa un peu d'eau avant d'aller s'installer sur son panier. Elle commença à se lécher lentement et avec précision, prenant soin de le faire tous les jours pour garder son beau pelage blanc propre et brillant.\\
Mais, au bout d'un moment, elle remarqua qu'elle perdait plus de poils que d'habitude. En effet, elle avait dû s'éclaircir la gorge en se débarrassant d'une boule de poils pour continuer sa toilette -- deux fois de suite !\\

Avec horreur, elle en conclut qu'elle était en train de devenir chauve. Dévastée, elle pensa qu'une fois tous ses poils tombés, Sarah ne l'aimerait plus et qu'elle la jetterait dehors. L'idée lui brisa le cœur, et elle décida de partir avant d'être forcée à faire face à l'inévitable.\\

Elle alla voir Sarah qui faisait sa sieste, la regarda tendrement avant de partir, la queue entre les pattes.\\
Une fois dehors, elle ne sut pas trop où aller ni quoi faire. Elle avait passé toute sa vie chez Sarah et n'avait aucune idée de comment survivre dans la nature... ou plutôt dans les jungles de ciment qui formaient la cité.\\

Pour le moment, elle décida d'errer sans but. En trottant le long de la rue, sa mélancolie s'effaça pour faire place à sa curiosité. Elle observa les bâtiments, les humains, les magasins et les quelques espaces verts qui décoraient la cité.\\
Une odeur délicieuse l'attira vers la façade d'un restaurant de grillades, et elle sentit son estomac vide protester, regrettant de ne pas avoir mangé quelques croquettes avant de sortir.\\

Fatiguée, affamée et terrifiée par cette grande ville sans fin, elle ne s'arrêta que lorsqu'elle sentit la langue d'un autre chat sur sa joue.\\
Elle tourna la tête brusquement pour voir qui était venu la réconforter et aperçut une vieille chatte de gouttière, probablement errante aussi, car elle ne portait pas de collier.\\

-- Tu as faim, je présume ? dit la vieille féline d'une douce voix.\\

-- O-oui... répondit Lily timidement.\\

-- Viens avec moi. Il y aura de bons morceaux de viande dans l'allée dans peu de temps.\\

Dégoûtée par l'idée de manger le contenu d'une poubelle, Lily fit une grimace qui fit sourire la vieille chatte.\\

-- Ne t'inquiète pas. Les cuisiniers de ce restaurant nous laissent souvent les restes sur des assiettes en mousse ou des boîtes en carton. La nourriture est propre.\\

Rassurée, Lily la suivit et s'installa avec elle au pied de l'escalier de secours du bâtiment voisin du restaurant.\\
La vieille chatte se présenta comme Agathe, et Lily se présenta en retour.\\
Tandis qu'elles attendaient leur repas, une autre chatte et deux petits chatons les rejoignirent.\\

La maman les salua, tandis que les deux petits continuaient à jouer ensemble.\\

-- On a de la compagnie aujourd'hui ? demanda la nouvelle arrivée à Agathe.\\

-- En effet. Cleo, je te présente Lily, répondit Agathe avant de dire à Lily que les deux chatons s'appelaient Max et Lu.\\

Un moment après, un humain du restaurant leur apporta des morceaux de viande grillée dans une boîte en carton et les caressa un peu avant de retourner à l'intérieur pour les laisser manger en paix.\\
Une fois rassasiées, le groupe de chats se dirigea vers un pont pour passer la nuit en dessous.\\
Telle était leur routine quotidienne : ils traversaient la cité pour aller manger puis retournaient s'abriter sous le pont.\\

Au bout de quelques jours, alors qu'ils étaient en route, Lily s'arrêta devant un lampadaire et regarda une affiche d'un air triste.\\

-- Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ? interrogea Agathe, qui n'avait pas encore vu l'affiche, et Lily la lui indiqua d'un mouvement de tête.\\

-- Oh ! C'est toi ! dit Agathe, et Lily hocha la tête.\\

-- C'est ma propriétaire, Sarah, qui a dû mettre ces affiches… Elle me manque tellement.\\

-- Pourquoi l'as-tu quittée alors ?\\

-- Parce que je ne voulais pas qu'elle me mette dehors, cria Lily.\\

-- Pourquoi te mettrait-elle dehors ? Si elle ne voulait pas de toi, elle ne se serait sans doute pas donné la peine de coller ces affiches.\\

-- Une fois que j'aurai perdu tous mes poils, elle n'aurait plus voulu de moi, dit Lily en baissant la tête.\\

-- Comment ça ? Tes poils m'ont l'air en parfait état.\\

-- Non ! Je suis en train de les perdre ! La semaine dernière, j'ai constaté que j'en perdais plus que d'habitude.\\

Agathe lui donna un petit coup de tête.\\

-- Tu n'es pas très futée, dis donc ?\\

Lily la regarda, offensée, et Agathe lui expliqua qu'il était tout à fait normal pour les chats de perdre plus de poils pendant le printemps et que, contrairement à ce qu'elle pensait, elle n'était pas en train de perdre tout son pelage.\\

-- Mais bon, tu es jeune, donc je suppose que c'est la première fois pour toi, dit la vieille chatte en haussant les épaules.\\
-- Rentre chez toi, je suis sûre que tu manques beaucoup à ta Sarah.\\

Rassurée de ne pas être en train de perdre son plus beau trait, Lily ne perdit plus de temps.\\
Elle remercia Agathe et Cleo et courut retrouver sa propriétaire et sa maison.\\

Give me a reading comprehension exercise for a student learning French. It should have a subsection for answers.,"Un beau matin de printemps, tandis que les fleurs étaient en éclosion et que les arbres secouaient leurs belles feuilles vertes, une enseignante annonça à sa classe qu'elle avait imprimé les photos prises durant leur voyage d'étude. \\
\textit{-J'ai fait quelques copies pour tout le monde !} leur dit-elle avec un joyeux sourire. \\

Les enfants poussèrent des cris de joie et papotèrent entre eux avec excitation quand ils reçurent les enveloppes contenant les images en question. \\
Freya, une des élèves de cette classe, ouvrit l'enveloppe et regarda les images ayant immortalisé leur sortie avec joie avant de les remettre dans son sac à dos, bien à l'abri entre deux livres pour éviter qu'elles ne se froissent. \\

Elle avait hâte de les montrer à ses parents et elle savait qu'ils les aimeraient autant qu'elle les avait aimées. \\
Une fois chez elle, son père choisit les images qu'il avait jugées les plus joyeuses et les encadra avant de les suspendre avec les autres photos de la famille sur le mur du couloir. \\

\textit{-Ton sourire est si grand dans ces photos, ma chérie,} dit-il à Freya alors que les deux admirèrent les photos qui avaient été ajoutées récemment. \\
Elle hocha la tête en accord. \\
Le voyage avait été très amusant et elle n'avait même pas eu besoin de sourire pour les photos vu qu'elle n'avait pas passé un moment sans sourire à travers la journée. \\

Le regard de Freya atterrit sur les autres photos qui étaient sur le mur et elle remarqua qu'elles étaient toutes des photos des membres de sa famille souriant avec joie ou bien même en train de rire. \\
Chaque photo produisait une joyeuse ambiance. \\

\textit{-Je me demande si...} murmura-t-elle à elle-même quand elle commença à y penser. \\
Maintenant qu'elle avait ça en tête, c'était le cas dans chaque maison où elle avait été : seulement des images ayant des personnes heureuses comme sujets étaient exposées sur les murs, bureaux et cheminées. \\

Pourquoi donc ? \\
\textit{-Peut-être parce que les gens sont affectés par les photos ?} pensa-t-elle en marchant le long du couloir. \\

C'était logique. Le plus de temps qu'elle passait à regarder les photos, le plus sa joie augmentait. \\
Elle vit une image de sa première fois où elle avait attrapé un poisson, quand elle avait accompagné son père au lac et sourit avec fierté. \\

\textit{-C'était une très bonne journée...} avoua-t-elle. \\

Puis, elle vit une photo qui avait été prise lorsque toute la famille était partie en voyage sur la route et rigola. \\
C'était tellement amusant malgré que son grand frère avait passé son temps à se plaindre sur le fait qu'il n'y avait pas d'internet. \\

La photo suivante qu'elle admira avait été prise lors de sa fête d'anniversaire. \\
La famille avait organisé la fête dans un restaurant et tous ses amis avaient été invités. \\
C'était tellement élégant et la nourriture était délicieuse et elle avait adoré chaque moment. \\

Elle se rappela qu'ils l'avaient taquinée en mettant de la crème chantilly sur son visage et rigola sur ce souvenir. \\

Ce n'était pas surprenant que ces photos étaient là, chacune d'elles reflétait des souvenirs heureux et inspiraient un sentiment de joie chez la personne qui les regardait. \\

Voulant explorer d'autres aspects de sa théorie, elle demanda à son père de lui donner l'album familial pour qu'elle puisse regarder les autres photos qui n'avaient pas mérité un emplacement d'honneur sur le mur. \\

Quand elle commença à feuilleter l'album, quelques-unes la firent rire à haute voix et quelques-unes la firent grimacer tandis que certaines la rendirent nostalgique et un peu triste. \\

La photo prise d'elle à l'âge de quatre ans vêtue d'un costume de fée et tenant une baguette magique la fit rigoler. \\
Elle adorait se déguiser et mettre des costumes ridicules comme celui-là quand elle était plus jeune et elle jouait toujours le rôle du personnage ayant inspiré son déguisement. \\

Toute la famille lui avait dit qu'elle se baladait autour de la maison en les touchant avec la baguette magique et en leur disant qu'elle venait d'exhausser leurs vœux et malgré qu'elle se rappelait à peine de cette journée, elle trouva quand même l'anecdote amusante. \\

Une autre image qui n'était pas aussi drôle captura son attention. \\
C'était une photo d'elle avec le visage enflé et avec une vilaine rougeur. \\
Elle avait mangé des noix pour la première fois et il s'était avéré qu'elle était allergique. \\

\textit{-J'ai l'air tellement bizarre...} murmura-t-elle à elle-même en regardant son visage tout rouge et ses yeux larmoyants. \\
\textit{Je suis tellement contente que cette photo n'est pas sur le mur d'honneur !} soupira-t-elle en secouant la tête. \\

Si ce n'était pas pour la crainte d'énerver ses parents, elle aurait jeté cette photo à la poubelle. \\
Elle pouvait s'imaginer faire la grimace à chaque fois qu'elle passerait par le couloir si cette photo y était. \\

C'était une image qui n'inspirait pas de joie en elle du tout. \\

Une autre photo l'arrêta et elle passa un moment à la regarder. \\
C'était une image de sa vieille maison. \\
Avant que sa famille ne déménage et ne s'installe dans leur maison actuelle, ils vivaient dans une très belle maison avec un grand jardin et une cabane dans un arbre. \\

Elle adorait y vivre et jouer dans la cabane avec ses anciens amis et cet endroit lui manquait tellement. \\
C'était tellement dommage qu'ils durent quitter cette maison à cause du travail de son père. \\

Malgré qu'elle avait aimé cet endroit, Freya était contente de ne pas s'en souvenir chaque jour. \\
Elle n'aimait pas trop le sentiment de nostalgie qu'elle ressentait en pensant à ces jours passés. \\

La dernière photo qu'elle avait regardée avant de fermer l'album était une photo de son grand-père décédé. \\
Freya l'aimait tellement et elle était si triste de ne plus jamais pouvoir le voir. \\

Sa mère lui avait dit qu'ils se souviendraient toujours de lui et qu'ils l'aimeraient à jamais et qu'il ne les avait pas vraiment quittés du moment qu'ils pensaient à lui, mais la petite fille ne put s'empêcher de ressentir de la tristesse en regardant sa photo. \\

Comme celle de son ancienne maison, elle pensait qu'il était pour le bien de tout le monde de ne pas voir cette image souvent à cause de la peine qu'elle ressentait en la regardant même si elle l'aimait très fort. \\

\textit{-Je comprends maintenant pourquoi seules les photos joyeuses sont sur le mur,} dit-elle avant de retourner en bas et de donner l'album à son père. \\

\textit{-Les photos ne nous rappellent pas seulement les souvenirs du passé mais aussi les sentiments qu'on a ressentis quand elles ont été prises.}

Give me a reading comprehension exercise for a student learning French. It should have a subsection for answers.,"\textit{-C'est trop calme ici,} Charlie dit en avançant avec prudence à travers les allées humides de la cité. Il faisait nuit, les lampadaires clignaient, tantôt allumés, tantôt éteints, et la lune était cachée par les nuages. \\
La rue était sombre et suspicieuse. \\
Il monta les escaliers de secours qui étaient sales et couverts de rouille puis, il se positionna sur le bord de la terrasse pour ensuite pouvoir regarder à travers le télescope de son fusil de tireur d'élite. \\
Il guetta les parages et garda l'œil grand ouvert pour voir s'il y avait n'importe quel signe de problème. \\

Quelques moments plus tard, les bruits perçants de tirs venant d'une arme à feu résonnèrent en bas. Il vit son partenaire courir hors d'un immeuble avant de s'abriter derrière un camion et il essaya de localiser l'ennemi. \\
Une fois qu'il repéra le tireur qui avait tiré sur son partenaire, il le cibla et l'élimina avec une seule balle sur le front. \\
\textit{""Mission accomplie. Ton équipe a gagné !""} les haut-parleurs de son casque annoncèrent, le tirant hors de l'atmosphère sérieuse du jeu. \\

\textit{-Bien joué, Chuck !} la voix de son partenaire et ami dit à travers son casque, le félicitant pour sa manœuvre talentueuse dans le jeu. \\
\textit{-Merci. Toi aussi ! Tu veux jouer une autre partie ?} Charlie demanda sur un ton excité. \\
\textit{-Je ne peux pas. Ma mère m'appelle pour le déjeuner. Peut-être plus tard !} \\
\textit{-D'accord. À plus tard, alors !} Charlie dit avant de se déconnecter. \\

Il ouvrit un autre jeu et était sur le point de lancer une partie quand sa mère l'appela pour descendre prendre son déjeuner. \\
Il soupira, déçu d'attendre jusqu'à plus tard pour jouer davantage et enleva son casque pour le poser sur son bureau avant de mettre son ordinateur en veille. \\

En sortant de sa chambre, il vit sa petite sœur descendre les escaliers pour aller à la cuisine pour le déjeuner et il perdit soudain tout contact avec la réalité et commença à voir son entourage comme un environnement de jeu. \\
Charlie avança à travers le couloir sans faire de bruit, il se cacha derrière des meubles et des chaises avant de descendre silencieusement les escaliers. \\

Une fois derrière sa petite sœur, il lui donna un petit coup sur la tête avec son index qui était pointé comme un pistolet. \\
\textit{-Pam ! Je t'ai eu !} dit-il. \\
\textit{-Arrête, tu es méchant !} sa petite sœur lui dit en se tournant pour lui taper la main. \\
\textit{-Tu n'es qu'une pleurnicheuse, Trixie !} dit-il. \textit{-Je vais arriver avant toi au quartier général !} \\

Et sur ce, il la poussa à côté et courut à la cuisine. Sa petite sœur roula les yeux au plafond à cause de son comportement et marcha calmement vers la cuisine. \\
\textit{-Maman, Charlie est en train de faire l'idiot encore une fois !} elle se plaignit avant de s'asseoir. \\
\textit{-Trix, qu'est-ce qu'on a dit à propos d'insulter ton frère ?} sa mère la réprimanda. \\
\textit{-Désolée...} la petite fille s'excusa avant de tirer la langue à Charlie qui était en train de lui sourire avec un air taquin. \\

\textit{-Merci d'avoir soutenu mon clan, grand maître.} Charlie dit à sa mère. \\
\textit{-Et merci pour ce festin.} Sa mère laissa échapper un rire et secoua la tête en le regardant. \\
\textit{-Je ne soutiens aucun clan, Charles. Tu ne dois pas embêter ta sœur,} dit-elle sur un ton strict mais pas cruel. \\

Charlie fit une grimace en entendant son prénom. \\
\textit{-Je ne l'embêtais pas ! Je jouais seulement avec elle ! Comme ça, regarde !} \\

Il prit une olive du plat de condiments, la mit sur sa cuillère puis plia la cuillère de façon à pouvoir tirer l'olive sur Trixie lorsqu'il la lâcherait. \\
\textit{-Charles, n'ose même pas y penser !} sa mère le prévint. \\
Le garçon soupira et posa la cuillère et l'olive. \\

\textit{-Personne n'apprécie mon talent...} Sa mère laissa échapper un soupir et décida qu'il était temps d'avoir une discussion sérieuse avec le garçon. \\
\textit{-Charlie, mon chou, tu dois cesser d'agir comme si tout était un jeu. Ton enseignant m'a appelé l'autre jour et m'a dit que tu t'es bagarré avec ton camarade et que tu as refusé de t'excuser.} \\

\textit{-Ça, c'était différent !} \\

\textit{-Quand tu lui as demandé pourquoi tu devais t'excuser et qu'il t'a dit que c'était parce que tu l'avais vexé, qu'avais-tu répondu ?} \\
\textit{-Je lui ai demandé comment il pouvait le savoir alors qu'il ne pouvait même pas lire ses données...} murmura-t-il en évitant de regarder sa mère dans les yeux. \\

\textit{-Oui, et je crois que tu sais bien que les gens ne peuvent pas... visualiser les données des autres, n'est-ce pas ?} \\
\textit{-Oui, Maman.} \\

\textit{-Et tu sais que tu ne dois pas jeter des olives sur ta sœur, pas vrai ?} \\
\textit{-Oui.} \\

\textit{-Et tu dois arrêter de dire que la maison du voisin est un ""territoire ennemi"", c'est offensant.} \\
\textit{-Mais leur chien ne cesse pas d'aboyer quand Trix et moi allons à l'école le matin !} il répondit en sa défense. \\

\textit{-Charlie,} sa mère dit pour le mettre en garde. \\
\textit{-D'accord, je ne vais plus dire ça...} \\

\textit{-Mon chéri, je ne veux pas te rendre triste. Mais si tu continues à agir comme ça, tu vas avoir des ennuis,} sa mère dit en caressant sa joue affectueusement. \\
\textit{Je m'inquiète pour toi, Charlie.} \\

Il se sentit coupable d'avoir inquiété sa mère et lui sourit d'un air penaud. \\
\textit{-Je suis désolé, maman. Parfois, je me laisse aller, mais je te promets que je vais essayer de mieux me comporter dorénavant.} \\

Give me a reading comprehension exercise for a student learning German. It should have a subsection for answers.,"Ich habe vor zwanzig Jahren als Taxifahrer gearbeitet. Einmal, mitten in der Nacht, kam ich nach einem Anruf zu einem Gebäude, das völlig im Dunkeln lag, bis auf ein Licht aus dem Fenster im Erdgeschoss.\\
\textit{I worked as a taxi driver twenty years ago. Once, in the middle of the night, I arrived at a call in a building that was completely in the dark except for one light from the window on the ground floor.}\\

Unter diesen Umständen würden viele Taxifahrer das Hupe nur ein- oder zweimal benutzen, eine Minute warten und dann losfahren. Aber ich sah zu viele arme Leute, die auf Taxis als einzige Transportmittel angewiesen waren. Wenn ich die Gefahr in der Luft nicht riechen würde, würde ich immer zur Tür gehen. Ein Passagier könnte jemand sein, der meine Hilfe braucht, dachte ich. Also, ging ich zur Tür und klopfte.\\
\textit{Under these circumstances, many taxi drivers would use the horn only once or twice, wait a minute and then drive off. But I saw too many poor people who were dependent on taxis as their only means of transport. If I did not smell the danger in the air, I would always go to the door. A passenger could be someone who needs my help, I thought. So I went to the door and knocked.}\\

""Einen Augenblick"", sagte eine brüchige, ältere Stimme. Ich hörte etwas auf dem Boden ziehen. Die Tür öffnete sich nach einer langen Pause. Vor mir stand eine kleine Frau in ihren Achtzigern. Sie trug ein Kleid mit einem Muster und einen Hut, an dem der Schleier befestigt war, wie jemand in einem Film aus den 40ern. Neben ihr war ein kleiner Koffer.\\
\textit{""Just a moment,"" said a brittle, older voice. I heard something pulling on the floor. The door opened after a long pause. In front of me was a small woman in her eighties. She wore a dress with a pattern and a hat on which the veil was attached, like someone from a 40's movie. Next to her was a small suitcase.}\\

Die Wohnung sah aus, als wäre sie jahrelang leer gestanden. Alle Möbel waren mit Laken bedeckt. Es gab keine Uhren an den Wänden, keine kleinen Dinge oder Geschirr auf der Theke. In der Ecke stand eine Pappschachtel voller Fotos und Glaswaren.\\
\textit{The apartment looked like no one had lived in it for years. All the furniture was covered with sheets. There were no clocks on the walls, no small things or dishes on the counter. In the corner was a cardboard box full of photographs and glassware.}\\

""Würden Sie bitte meine Tasche zum Auto bringen"" sagte sie. Ich nahm den Koffer zum Taxi, und dann kam ich zurück, um der Frau zu helfen. Sie nahm meine Hand und ging langsam zum Rand des Bürgersteigs. Sie dankte mir weiterhin für meine Freundlichkeit. \\
\textit{""Would you please take my bag to the car,"" she said. I took the suitcase to the taxi, and then I came back to help the woman. She took my hand and we walked slowly towards the edge of the sidewalk. She kept on thanking me for my kindness. }\\

""Oh, nichts zu danken"", sagte ich ihr. ""Ich versuche nur meine Passagiere so zu behandeln, wie ich möchte, dass andere meine Mutter behandeln."" \\
\textit{""Oh, no need to thank me,"" I told her. ""I'm just trying to treat my passengers as I would like others to treat my mother.""} \\

""Oh, du bist so ein guter Junge"", sagte sie. Als wir das Taxi betraten, gab sie mir die Adresse und dann fragte sie mich: ""Können wir durch die Innenstadt fahren?"" \\
\textit{""Oh, you are such a good boy,"" she said. When we entered the cab, she gave me the address and then she asked me, ""Could we go through the city center?"" }\\

""Es ist nicht der kürzeste Weg"", antwortete ich schnell. \\
\textit{""It's not the shortest way,"" I replied quickly.} \\

""Das macht nichts"", sagte sie. ""Ich habe es nicht eilig. Ich bin auf dem Weg ins Krankenhaus."" \\
\textit{""It does not matter,"" she said. ""I'm not in a hurry. I'm on my way to the hospital.""} \\

Ich schaute in den Spiegel. Ihre Augen glitzerten. \\
\textit{I looked in the mirror. Her eyes glittered. }\\

""Ich habe keine Familie mehr"", fuhr sie fort. ""Ärzte sagen, ich habe nicht mehr viel Zeit."" \\
\textit{""I no longer have any family,"" she continued. ""Doctors say I don't have a lot of time left.""} \\

Ich beugte mich vor und drehte den Taxameter um. ""Welchen Weg soll ich nehmen?"", Fragte ich. \\
\textit{I leaned in and turned down the taximeter. ""Which way would you like to go,"" I asked.} \\

Wir fuhren für die nächsten zwei Stunden durch die Stadt. Sie zeigte mir das Gebäude, in dem sie als Fahrstuhlführerin arbeitete. Wir gingen durch die Nachbarschaft, wo sie und ihr Ehemann lebten. Sie bat mich, vor einem Möbelgeschäft anzuhalten, das früher ein Tanzsalon war, in den sie als Mädchen ging. Manchmal bat sie mich gebeten, vor einem Gebäude oder einer Ecke abzubremsen, und sie saß da und schaute in die Dunkelheit, ohne etwas zu sagen. Als der erste Strahl der Sonne am Horizont erschien, sagte sie plötzlich: ""Ich bin müde. Lass uns jetzt gehen.""\\
\textit{We drove through the city for the next two hours. She showed me the building where she used to work as an elevator operator. We walked through the neighbourhood where she and her husband lived. She asked me to stop in front of a furniture store that used to be a dancing salon where she was going as a girl. Sometimes she would ask me to slow down in front of some building or corner, and she sat staring into the darkness, not saying anything. When the first rays of the sun began to appear on the horizon, she suddenly said: ""I'm tired. Let's go now.""}\\

Schweigend fuhren wir zu der Adresse, die sie mir gegeben hatte.\\
\textit{In silence we drove to the address she gave me.}\\

Es war ein kleines Gebäude. Als wir anhielten, kamen zwei Männer zum Taxi. Voller Aufmerksamkeit folgten sie jeder Bewegung. Sie müssen sie erwartet haben. Ich öffnete den Kofferraum und nahm den kleinen Koffer zur Tür. Die Frau saß schon im Rollstuhl.\\
\textit{It was a small building. Two men came to the taxi as soon as we stopped. Full of attention, they followed every movement. They must have expected her. I opened the trunk and took the small suitcase to the door. The woman was already sitting in a wheelchair.}\\

""Wie viel schulde ich dir?"", Fragte sie und öffnete ihre Handtasche.\\
\textit{""How much do I owe you,"" she asked, opening her purse.}\\

""Nichts"", antwortete ich.\\
\textit{""Nothing,"" I replied.} \\

""Du musst von etwas leben"", antwortete sie. \\
\textit{""You must live from something,"" she replied.} \\

""Es gibt andere Passagiere."" \\
\textit{""There are other passengers.""} \\

Fast ohne nachzudenken, beugte ich mich vor und umarmte sie. \\
\textit{Almost without thinking, I leaned over and hugged her.} \\

""Du hast einer alten Frau einen glücklichen Moment geschenkt"", sagte sie. ""Danke."" \\
\textit{""You gave an old woman one moment of happiness,"" she said. ""Thank you.""} \\

Ich drückte ihre Hand und ging in das neblige Morgenlicht. Hinter mir schloss sich die Tür. Es war der Klang des Endes eines Lebens. \\
\textit{I squeezed her hand and walked into the foggy morning light. Behind me, the door closed. It was the sound of the end of life.} \\

In dieser Schicht habe ich keine anderen Passagiere mitgenommen. Ich war in meinen Gedanken verloren. Und den Rest des Tages sprach ich kaum. Was wäre, wenn die Frau einen wütenden Fahrer bekommen hätte oder jemanden, der seine Schicht beenden wollte? Was, wenn ich mich geweigert hätte, sie mitzunehmen? Wenn ich darüber nachdenke, denke ich, dass es das Wichtigste ist, was ich in meinem Leben getan habe. Wir sind überzeugt, dass sich unser Leben um wichtige Momente dreht. Aber wichtige Momente treffen uns oft unvorbereitet - schön verpackt in etwas, das manche als unwichtig bezeichnen würden. \\
\textit{In that shift, I did not take any other passengers. I was lost in my thoughts. And the rest of that day, I barely spoke. What if the woman got an angry driver, or someone who was eager to finish the shift? What if I refused to take her? When I think about it, I think that's the most important thing I've done in my life. We are convinced that we think that our lives revolve around important moments. But important moments often take us unprepared - beautifully packaged in what some would call unimportant.}

Give me a reading comprehension exercise for a student learning French. It should have a subsection for answers.,"Pingouin regardait autour de lui avec crainte et curiosité. Il se laissait emporter par tout ce qu'il voyait dans la volière : il comprenait l'intérêt des perchoirs, des mangeoires et des points d'eau, mais, à son avis, les barreaux n'étaient pas nécessaires. Il se dit que là où il avait l'habitude de traîner, personne ne pouvait voler de toute façon, avec ou sans barreaux.\\

Ses pensées furent interrompues par la rapide descente d'un oiseau. C'était un faucon à l'apparence majestueuse et aux yeux perçants. L'oiseau se tourna vers lui, le regarda et le salua d'un hochement de tête avant de rediriger son regard droit devant lui, tel un bon soldat. Un moment plus tard, une chouette les rejoignit. Elle ne prêta attention à aucun d'entre eux et se percha en silence. Pingouin la regarda avant de détourner son regard vers le faucon et ne sut qui l'intimidait le plus. Une chose était sûre : les deux étaient impressionnants, surtout comparés à lui.\\

-- Désolé pour le retard, messieurs dames ! Pingouin entendit avant de voir un corbeau atterrir à côté de lui. Contrairement aux autres oiseaux aux yeux menaçants, ce corbeau avait un regard espiègle et un peu moqueur. Il sourit à Pingouin et lui fit un clin d'œil. Pingouin, ne sachant que dire, se contenta de sourire au corbeau maladroitement. Certes, il n'était pas aussi intimidant que les deux autres, mais il avait du charisme.\\

Après quelques instants de silence, un grand aigle descendit sur les quatre animaux et s'installa sur le grand perchoir au centre de la volière. L'oiseau, déjà immense, paraissait encore plus imposant de cette position. Pingouin le regarda avec émerveillement, non seulement parce qu'il était le plus grand oiseau présent, mais parce qu'il avait un regard strict et une posture droite qui commandait l'attention de tous dans la volière.\\

-- Bonjour et merci pour votre présence aujourd'hui, dit-il d'une voix rauque.\\

-- Ce n'est pas comme si on avait le choix, on a pratiquement été convoqués, hein ? murmura Corbeau à Pingouin en le poussant du coude avec complicité, avant de se redresser en voyant le regard irrité de l'aigle fixé sur lui.\\

Les quatre oiseaux savaient bien ce qui arrivait aux animaux convoqués par les autorités : ils devenaient agents pour protéger le zoo et partaient en missions secrètes pour libérer des animaux capturés et maltraités par des humains.\\

-- Je suis Maître Aigle, votre commandant. Je vais superviser vos entraînements et vos missions. Chacun d'entre vous a été convoqué pour son talent et son potentiel. Même si vous êtes habitués à vivre parmi les vôtres, vous êtes tous différents, et pour cela, vous allez apprendre à travailler en équipe et à survivre ensemble dans différents environnements.\\

Pingouin pensa que cela était vrai pour les autres oiseaux : même Corbeau semblait spécial à sa manière. Mais il doutait d'avoir lui-même du “talent et du potentiel” comme Maître Aigle l'avait dit.\\

-- Peut-être que je suis censé leur ramener de l'eau après leurs entraînements, pensa-t-il, distrait.\\

Après que Maître Aigle eut fini de parler, le grillage de la volière se transforma pour prendre l'apparence de murs sombres et métalliques, chassant la lumière du jour hors de la pièce. Les perchoirs prirent un aspect bleu lumineux et plusieurs écrans s'allumèrent.\\

-- Votre première mission aura lieu dans un environnement forestier. Assurez-vous de vous nourrir, de vous protéger et de prendre soin les uns des autres. Si l'un de vous échoue, toute l'équipe échoue.\\

Leur première mission se passa bien, tout comme les deux suivantes, qui eurent lieu dans un désert et dans une cité. Faucon et Chouette utilisèrent leurs talents de chasseurs, et Corbeau, son intelligence et sa ruse pour trouver de la nourriture. Pingouin, ne mangeant pas les mêmes choses qu'eux, pouvait jeûner grâce à ses réserves de graisse et ne leur causa pas de problème sur ce point. Cependant, il n'était ni capable de se battre ni de chasser. Même si ses coéquipiers ne lui faisaient jamais de remarques blessantes, il se sentait inutile.\\

Leur quatrième mission se déroula en Antarctique, un endroit couvert de neige et de glace. Il n'y avait presque pas de proies à chasser ni d'endroits pour s'abriter. Le seul qui s'intégrait parfaitement à l'environnement était Pingouin avec son ventre blanc.\\

-- Je ne vois rien, dit Faucon, inquiet.\\

-- Rien que du blanc, tu veux dire, dit Corbeau en riant un peu.\\

-- Eh bien, il n'y a pas grand-chose à voir. La plupart des animaux ici ont une fourrure blanche, ce qui ne facilite pas les choses, expliqua Pingouin. Mais on peut pêcher ! Il y a plein de poissons, et vous pouvez tous en manger, n'est-ce pas ?\\

-- Oui, mais on n'est pas tous capables de plonger sous l'eau, et la glace ne me permet pas d'attraper les poissons en surface, répondit Faucon.\\

-- Je vais pêcher pour vous ! Je suis très doué pour ça, dit Pingouin, content de pouvoir enfin se rendre utile.\\

Il plongea sous l'eau et nagea à grande vitesse, remontant régulièrement pour déposer des poissons pour ses coéquipiers. Après un moment, il avait accumulé un tas de poissons qu'il partagea avec eux.\\

Quand ils retournèrent à la volière, Pingouin comprit que même lui, qui n'était pas aussi majestueux et fort que les autres, avait ses points forts. Leur équipe termina la formation et ils devinrent officiellement des agents de la volière.\\

Sa chambre était sombre, éclairée que par la lumière de l'éclair occasionnellement. \\
Il laissa échapper un soupir misérable, il était tellement ennuyé et même un peu effrayé. \\

Il se leva et fit son chemin à travers sa chambre lentement pour aller à la chambre de son frère et malheureusement, il se cogna le pied contre le cadre de la porte. \\
\textit{-Ouille !} murmura-t-il, n'osant pas parler à haute voix. \\

Quand il arriva enfin à la porte de son frère, des bruits forts de quelqu'un qui frappait à la porte le firent sursauter. \\
Qui pourrait bien leur rendre visite à cette heure ? Et au bon milieu d'une tempête ? \\
Oh, non... Oliver avait vu assez de films d'horreur pour savoir comment ça allait finir ! \\

Son frère ouvrit la porte de sa chambre, le faisant sursauter de surprise. \\
\textit{-Qu'est-ce que tu fais là, mon grand ?} son frère demanda. \\

\textit{-Je m'ennuyais...} Oliver dit en haussant les épaules. \\
\textit{-Est-ce qu'on vient de frapper à la porte ? J'avais mes écouteurs aux oreilles et donc je ne suis pas sûr.} \\

Oliver hocha la tête et jeta un regard aux escaliers avec agitation. \\
La personne qui avait frappé à la porte venait de le refaire et ne s'arrêta pas cette fois-ci. \\

Ses parents choisirent ce moment-là pour quitter leur chambre. \\
\textit{-Pourquoi êtes-vous debout à cette heure ?} leur mère demanda avec mécontentement tandis que leur père descendit l'escalier pour voir qui frappait à leur porte. \\

Les deux garçons ne répondirent pas et l'aîné suivit son père en bas. \\
Oliver préféra rester avec sa mère et quand les deux entendirent le bruit de la porte qu'on ouvrait, ils descendirent avec hésitation pour voir qui était leur visiteur impatient. \\

\textit{-Julie ?!} sa mère demanda avec étonnement en voyant une femme tremblante devant la porte enlever son manteau trempé. \\
\textit{-Quelle tempête !} la femme dit, son visage crispé et contrarié. \\

\textit{-Qu'est-ce qui t'a fait venir à cette heure ?} la mère d'Oliver demanda. \\

Mais c'était son père qui prit la parole. \\
\textit{-J'étais en train de lui poser la même question.} \\

\textit{-Je voulais vous surprendre. Je viens de rentrer de mon voyage et j'ai conduit une voiture de location jusqu'ici. Comme une idiote, je n'ai pas vu la météo et le motel où j'avais prévu de rester sur mon chemin était complet et donc je n'avais pas d'autres choix que de continuer à conduire malgré que je savais que j'allais arriver à cette heure inappropriée.} La dame expliqua rapidement. \\

Le temps qu'il faisait l'avait clairement rendu de mauvaise humeur. \\

Oliver regarda son frère et vit que, comme lui, il était surpris de voir cette dame ici. Peut-être qu'il ne savait pas qui c'était non plus ? Il allait devoir lui demander plus tard. \\

Le petit garçon fronça ses sourcils et la regarda de la tête aux pieds. \\
Elle était habillée complètement en noir : des pantalons noirs, une blouse noire, un manteau noir et des bottes noires. \\

Même ses cheveux étaient noirs d'après ce qu'il pouvait voir grâce à la torche de son père. \\

\textit{-Et je vois qu'il n'y a pas de courant en plus. Génial !} dit la dame avec amertume. \\
\textit{-Viens avec moi, je vais te donner des serviettes pour te sécher les cheveux. Je suppose que tu as ramené tes vêtements avec toi ?} la mère d'Oliver demanda. \\

\textit{-Oui, mais il n'y a aucune chance que je ressorte sous la pluie pour les chercher dans la voiture !} Julie répondit en tremblant. \\

\textit{-Tu devrais lui prêter quelque chose pour ce soir, ma chérie. Je vais faire chauffer de l'eau pour une tasse de thé bien chaud,} le papa d'Oliver suggéra et quand leur invité marcha en avant pour aller avec sa mère, elle vit le petit garçon. \\

\textit{-Oh, salut petit. Tu dois être Oly.} dit-elle. \\

\textit{-Oliver,} il la corrigea. \\

\textit{-D'accord. Et bien, à demain.} Et sur ce, elle s'en alla. \\

Le père d'Oliver lui demanda à lui et à son frère de retourner en haut et les deux garçons obéirent. \\

En montant, Oliver demanda à son frère s'il avait déjà entendu parler de cette personne. Était-elle un membre éloigné de la famille ou un truc du genre ? \\

\textit{-C'est l'amie de maman de l'université, elles étaient inséparables et elles sont restées en contact. La seule autre fois où elle est venue, c'était quand tu étais un petit bébé, c'est pour ça que tu ne te rappelles pas d'elle,} le plus âgé des deux garçons expliqua. \\

Oliver n'avait pas du tout aimé cette dame. Il la trouva suspicieuse. \\
Il était clair que ses parents la connaissaient et ils se comportaient comme s'ils lui faisaient confiance, la laissant entrer chez eux et tout, mais il avait un mauvais pressentiment la concernant. \\

Oliver lâcha soudainement un souffle horrifié en ayant une pensée effrayante. \\
Et si cette femme était en réalité une sorcière métamorphe qui s'était fait passer pour l'amie de maman ?! Oh, non ! Et quand tout le monde serait endormi, elle les tuerait tous ! \\

Il entendit les voix de sa mère et de la fausse Julie parler tandis qu'elle s'installait dans la chambre d'invités et décida d'aller la confronter quand ses parents retourneraient dans leur chambre. \\

Il attendit une demi-heure environ et quand il était sûr que la voie était libre, il se faufila hors de sa chambre en silence. \\

La porte de la chambre d'invités était légèrement ouverte et il vit qu'il y avait une bougie allumée à l'intérieur. \\
La lumière produite par la flamme projetait des ombres intenses contre le mur et il put voir la silhouette courbée de la fausse Julie qui était assise sur le lit à un angle étrange et il entendit les sons de toux et de crachats. \\

Elle était sûrement en train de reprendre sa forme d'origine ! \\

Il ouvrit la porte, faisant tourner la fausse Julie vers lui avec un sursaut. \\
\textit{-Oh, c'est toi ! Tu m'as fait peur, petit !} dit-elle avec une main sur sa poitrine. \\

Elle avait toujours une apparence humaine et en marchant à l'intérieur de la chambre, il vit qu'elle tenait une serviette en papier. \\

\textit{-Julie,} avait un sourire penaud aux lèvres et elle mit un doigt devant elle. \\
\textit{-Ne dis pas à ton père, mais ce thé est dégueulasse !} \\

Oliver comprit que le son qu'il avait entendu était fait par elle en crachant le thé dans le mouchoir et il rigola d'amusement. \\
Le thé de son père était infect, il le savait par expérience ! \\

\textit{-Hé, tu veux un peu de chocolat ? Je l'ai apporté avec moi de mon voyage en Suisse !} Julie dit en sortant une barre de chocolat de son sac. \\
\textit{-Ne dis pas à ta maman, par contre. Je suis sûre qu'elle n'approuverait pas le fait que tu manges des sucreries la nuit.} \\

Elle lui fit un clin d'œil avec un sourire espiègle. \\
Oliver prit la barre de chocolat et s'assit sur le lit à côté d'elle. \\

\textit{-Tu as été en Suisse ?} demanda-t-il avec curiosité. \\

\textit{-Ouai. Tu veux voir des photos ?} Elle n'attendit pas sa réponse et prit son téléphone de la table de chevet. \\

Olivier passa la nuit avec qui il appela maintenant Tante Julie, il avait écouté ses histoires sur ses voyages autour du monde et sur le temps qu'elle avait passé avec sa mère à l'université quand elles étaient plus jeunes. \\

Quand il s'endormit, sa dernière pensée était que Tante Julie était la plus gentille, la plus cool et la plus drôle des sorcières métamorphes au monde !

Give me a reading comprehension exercise for a student learning French. It should have a subsection for answers.,"Aujourd'hui, c'était la journée des idiomes! Chaque année à l'école d'Emma, une journée était dédiée pour un jeu élaboré que les enfants jouaient où ils préparaient des costumes, un dessin, un poème ou quoi que ce soit pour indiquer et donner des indices sur un idiome particulier et leurs camarades devaient le deviner et donner sa signification. Les enseignants pensaient que c'était une façon merveilleuse d'apprendre aux enfants des idiomes populaires et leur signification et les élèves aimaient le jeu amusant, surtout car ils pouvaient choisir l'idiome qu'ils utiliseraient avec l'aide de leurs parents.

Plus l'idiome était ridicule, mieux c'était et ils firent de leur mieux chaque année pour rendre le jeu aussi amusant que possible. Emma s'assit à sa place et les enfants se calmèrent et prêtèrent attention au premier idiome. L'un de leurs camarades portait un costume de chien et quand l'enseignant leur dit qu'ils pouvaient commencer à deviner, les enfants commencèrent à dire ce qu'ils croyaient être l'idiome représenté.

\textit{-Chien en vie en vaut mieux que lion mort.} L'un des garçons dit à haute voix. Le garçon qui portait le costume fronça ses sourcils et secoua sa tête, indiquant que ce n'était pas ça.

\textit{-Chien hargneux à toujours oreille déchirée.} Un autre s'écria. Mais, sa réponse n'était pas correcte.

\textit{-Qui m'aime, aime mon chien?} Emma dit avec hésitation. C'était le seul idiome de chien qu'elle connaissait en plus de ceux qui avaient été mentionnés par les autres.

\textit{-Non. Désolé.} Le garçon dit. \textit{Voici un indice.} Il commença ensuite à aboyer.

\textit{-Les chiens aboient et la caravane passe!} Un garçon cria avec enthousiasme.

\textit{-Oui! C'est la bonne réponse.} Le garçon qui représentait l'idiome avait dit avant de commencer à expliquer que celui-ci signifie que ce que disent ou pensent les autres ne nous empêche pas d'accomplir ce qu'on veut.

L'élève suivante était une fille qui avait décidé de faire deviner son idiome petit à petit à travers une charade qu'elle allait mimer. Elle commença par lever un petit doigt.

\textit{-Le premier mot!} Emma dit et la fille hocha la tête avant de commencer à mimer la signification du premier mot. Elle toucha son poignet, la tapotant avec l'index de l'autre main.

\textit{-Une main?} Le garçon assis à côté d'Emma devina. Elle secoua son doigt, indiquant que ce n'était pas ça avant de se retourner et de pointer un doigt à l'horloge qui était suspendue sur le mur de la classe, au-dessus du tableau.

\textit{-L'horloge!} Une autre enfant dit et quand elle inclina la tête pour lui indiquer qu'elle était proche, une autre dit.

\textit{-Le temps.} Ce qui était la bonne réponse. Ensuite, elle agita sa main pour dessiner un demi-cercle en l'air.

\textit{-Un cerceau? Un ballon? Une fenêtre? La lettre ""C""?} Elle continua à secouer la tête jusqu'à la dernière suggestion et indiqua que c'était ça. Puis, la fille leva trois doigts pour indiquer qu'elle allait mimer le dernier mot qui allait les aider à deviner. Elle leva la main et frotta son pouce contre son index et son majeur.

\textit{-Pincer ?} Cette réponse était fausse et elle secoua la tête.

\textit{-Monnaie?} Elle hocha la tête et fit un geste de la main pour leur indiquer de lui donner des synonymes du mot.

\textit{-Pièces? -Billets? -Argent !} La fille pointa du doigt le garçon qui avait deviné le mot \textit{Argent} et commença à sauter pour indiquer aux autres garçons que sa réponse était la bonne. Puis elle leva successivement son index suivi de son majeur et son annulaire, indiquant aux autres de se rappeler des trois mots.

\textit{-Temps, C, Argent...?} \textit{Le temps c'est de l'argent!} Emma s'écria. Sa mère utilisait toujours cet idiome pour inciter ses enfants à commencer à faire leurs devoirs, elle n'arrivait pas à croire qu'elle n'y avait pas pensé plus tôt.

\textit{-Oui! C'est exact!} \textit{Le temps c'est de l'argent} est un idiome traduit de l'Anglais qui signifie que bien employer son temps engendre un profit. Elle expliqua avec un grand sourire avant de retourner s'asseoir à sa place.

Emma pensa que cet idiome était son préféré et pas parce qu'elle avait réussi à le deviner correctement, mais à cause des efforts de la fille pour leur faire deviner l'idiome de manière amusante.

L'élève suivant qui était monté au tableau dessina un triangle avec une fraise au-dessus.

\textit{-Celui-ci est trop facile!} Dit l'un de ses camarades.

\textit{-On pourrait même dire que c'est du gâteau !} Un de ses amis compléta. Les deux garçons qui avaient dit ceci se tapèrent la main avec un sourire complice.

Et après leurs mots, il n'y avait aucun besoin d'expliquer l'expression et Emma pensa qu'en effet, c'était quelque chose de facile à deviner bien qu'elle doutait du fait que l'expression \textit{Du gâteau} pouvait être considérée comme un idiome. Maintenant, elle devait passer au tableau à son tour.

Elle prit un souffle avant de monter et elle se contenta de mettre un serre-tête avec des oreilles de chat, tout simplement, pour représenter son idiome. Son déguisement n'était rien de sophistiqué mais elle pensait que l'idiome qu'elle avait choisi était un peu difficile à deviner et elle était très excitée.

\textit{-Avoir un chat dans la gorge?} Dit un garçon qui s'asseyait d'habitude derrière elle et elle secoua sa tête, ce n'était pas ça.

\textit{-Appeler un chat un chat?} L'une des filles dit en inclinant sa tête sur le côté.

\textit{-Non,} dit-elle en baillant. Elle ne voulait pas donner plus d'indices que ça, sinon ça serait trop clair.

\textit{-La nuit, tous les chats sont gris.}

\textit{-Incorrecte.} Dit-elle en faisant semblant de s'endormir. Elle ne savait même pas ce que la dernière suggestion d'idiome signifiait.

\textit{-Oh! N'éveillez pas le chat qui dort !} L'un des garçons devina enfin et elle hocha la tête.

\textit{-On dit ""Ne réveillez pas le chat qui dort."" Pour dire de ne pas invoquer des histoires anciennes qui pourraient causer des problèmes.} Dit-elle en enlevant son serre-tête avant de reprendre sa place. Elle s'était bien amusée. Elle était un peu stressée au début mais après, ça avait passé.

L'idiome suivant était présenté par deux garçons qui se tenaient la main et qui regardaient droit devant eux. Ils semblaient marcher avec maladresse ou du moins, ils prétendaient marcher maladroitement.

\textit{-Voici un indice: On ne peut rien voir.} Dit l'un des deux garçons et attendit que ses camarades devinent l'idiome en question.

\textit{-Au royaume des aveugles, les borgnes sont rois?}

\textit{-Non. Essaye encore une fois.}

\textit{-Avoir des yeux pour ne rien voir?} Emma dit en faisant une petite grimace. Bien qu'elle savait que l'idiome voulait dire faire comme si de rien n'était, elle le trouva bizarre.

Les deux garçons rigolèrent. \textit{-Elle est bonne, celle-là! Mais, non.}

\textit{-Un aveugle sans bâton ?} Un garçon suggéra avec un sourire.

\textit{-Oh, pas mal! Mais ce n'est pas ça non plus.} L'un des garçons lui dit.

\textit{-Un aveugle qui en conduit un autre!} Lily, la meilleure amie d'Emma devina.

\textit{-Oui!} Les garçons l'applaudirent. Dire de quelqu'un que c'est un aveugle qui en conduit un autre signifie que cette personne est aussi impudente ou ignorante que celle qu'elle dirige. Les garçons sourirent à leurs camarades avant de retourner s'asseoir.

Les enfants continuèrent ainsi jusqu'à ce qu'il soit temps pour eux de rentrer chez eux. Leur enseignant les remercia et leur dit qu'il était fier d'eux et les informa qu'il allait y avoir un vote le jour suivant pour l'idiome le plus amusant. Emma ne pensait pas qu'elle allait gagner mais ce n'était pas important car elle s'était beaucoup amusée!

Give me a reading comprehension exercise for a student learning French. It should have a subsection for answers.,"Deux chevaliers étaient dans le champ de bataille, avec seulement la lumière aveuglante du soleil comme leur témoin. Les deux se tenaient en position de combat et s'encerclaient. Peu de temps s'écoula avant que l'un d'eux n'attaqua l'autre avec un cri de guerre. Il se lança sur son adversaire qui bloqua son épée avec la sienne. \textit{Claque !} Seuls les bruits de fer battant le fer pouvaient s'entendre tandis que les deux s'affrontèrent. \\

Ils firent beaucoup d'efforts pour coordonner leurs mouvements, levant leurs armes pour attaquer et basculant leurs corps pour esquiver les coups de l'autre. Ce n'était que lorsque l'un d'eux exécuta un mouvement assez fort pour désarmer son adversaire que la bataille se termina. Le vainqueur se tint avec son épée pointée vers son ennemi qui avait levé les mains en l'air en signe de soumission puis baissa son arme. \\

Les deux chevaliers enlevèrent leurs casques et se serrèrent la main avec un sourire. \textit{-C'était un bel effort,} le gagnant dit. \textit{-Mais tu dois t'entraîner davantage.} Le perdant lui tira la langue et lui dit qu'il le savait déjà. \\

\textit{-Grand frère !} Un petit garçon courut soudainement vers le chevalier vainqueur. \textit{-Tu as encore gagné ! Tu es le meilleur !} Son grand frère lui ébouriffa les cheveux avant de le prendre dans ses bras puis le mit sur ses épaules. \textit{-Oui, Edward et tu vas être comme moi quand tu seras plus grand, d'ailleurs, tu seras encore meilleur que moi !} \\

Les deux allèrent à l'intérieur du château pour voir s'ils pourraient avoir quelque chose à grignoter avant le déjeuner et en faisant leur chemin vers la cuisine, ils entendirent les hauts cris de la cuisinière. \textit{-Qui était-ce ? Lequel d'entre vous a osé voler l'agneau ?} Elle hurla sur trois gardes et deux femmes de chambre. Aucun d'eux ne répondit et ils échangèrent des expressions inquiètes entre eux. \\

Le chevalier et son petit frère entrèrent dans la cuisine et quand la cuisinière les vit, son visage s'éclaira. \textit{-Ah ! Sire Maximilian ! Je suis heureuse de vous voir. Veuillez dire à ces mécréants d'admettre lequel d'eux a volé mon gigot d'agneau. Il était censé être servi sur la table du roi pour le dîner de ce soir !} Dit-elle en jetant un regard plein de réprimande sur les femmes de chambre et les gardes qui étaient là-bas. \\

\textit{-Vous... avez perdu un gigot d'agneau ?} Maximilian demanda en arquant un sourcil. \\

\textit{-Mais bien sûr que non ! Qui pourrait bien perdre un objet aussi large ? Je ne l'ai pas perdu. Il a été volé, évidement !} La cuisinière répondit en roulant les yeux au plafond. \\

Maximilian hocha la tête et s'excusa de l'avoir mal compris. \textit{-Quand l'avez-vous vu la dernière fois ?} Demanda-t-il. \\

\textit{-Il était sous la table, en train de mariner tranquillement dans une grande marmite avec des herbes et des épices. Je l'ai couvert avec ce torchon.} Elle lui montra un grand morceau de tissu. \textit{Et quand je suis retournée à la cuisine, il n'était plus là ! La marmite était vide et seul le torchon était sur la table.} Lui dit-elle avec un soupir misérable. \\

\textit{-J'ai mis un autre gigot dans la marmite pour le dîner de ce soir et donc sa majesté le roi ne va pas en souffrir, mais le coupable doit être capturé !} \\

\textit{-En effet.} Le jeune homme dit en hochant la tête. \\

\textit{-Si vous permettez, Sire Maximilian... ?} L'une des femmes de chambre dit. \\

\textit{-Allez-y, je vous en prie.} \\

\textit{-Je me suis rendu à la cuisine il y a une heure. J'ai vu la marmite vide et j'ai cru que c'était étonnant mais je ne l'ai pas touchée. Le torchon était par terre et donc je l'ai ramassé et plié avant de le mettre sur la table, puis j'ai nettoyé le sol avant d'aller dans le jardin. Je ne suis retournée que maintenant pour trouver la cuisinière en train de crier à propos du gigot perdu. Celui ou celle qui l'a pris l'a sûrement fait avant que je ne sois rentrée dans la cuisine.} La jeune femme de chambre dit. \\

Maximilian hocha la tête en signe de compréhension avant de retourner son attention aux auteurs. \textit{-Est-ce que l'un de vous s'est rendu à la cuisine avant cela ?} L'autre femme de chambre et les gardes dirent non et il trouva le fait que seuls ceux qui étaient dans la pièce travaillaient dans la cuisine. \\

Le jeune frère de Maximilian prit la parole. \textit{-Est-ce que le sol de la cuisine était sale quand vous avez mariné le gigot d'agneau ce matin ?} Le petit garçon demanda à la cuisinière avec curiosité. \\

\textit{-Non. La cuisine est toujours nettoyée la nuit et quand je suis venue préparer l'agneau, il n'y avait même pas un grain de poussière sur le sol.} La cuisinière répondit. \\

Edward demanda en plus à la femme de chambre qui avait parlé auparavant pourquoi elle avait nettoyé le sol. \\

\textit{-Parce qu'il y avait une traînée de graisses sur le sol menant à la porte arrière. Il y avait aussi de la terre sur la traînée.} Dit-elle. \\

Le petit garçon regarda son frère et dit que cela devait signifier que celui ou celle qui avait pris l'agneau devait l'avoir traîné au jardin et cela expliquerait la traînée de graisse et ce que la femme de chambre pensait être de la terre devait être les épices et les herbes. \\

\textit{-Oui, c'est logique. As-tu vu l'un des enfants traîner quelque chose hors de la cuisine ?} Son grand-frère demanda. \\

Seul un enfant aurait besoin de traîner un gigot d'agneau puisqu'un adulte serait assez fort pour le porter. \\

\textit{-Non, mais je crois que je sais qui est le voleur.} Le petit garçon prit ensuite la main de son frère et le tira hors de la cuisine et dans le jardin jusqu'à ce qu'ils arrivèrent à la niche du chien du prince. \\

Quand Maximilian s'agenouilla par terre et regarda à l'intérieur, il trouva le chien endormi, blotti autour du gigot perdu qui était à présent à moitié consommé. \\

La cuisinière, les femmes de chambre et les gardes suivirent le jeune chevalier qui se tourna vers eux avec un sourire. \textit{-Je crois que ça résout notre devinette.} Puis, il se tourna vers la cuisinière et mit un bras autour des épaules d'Edward. \textit{-Je crois qu'il a mérité une gâterie pour avoir résolu le mystère, pas vrai ?} \\

La cuisinière claqua sa langue, lamentant le gigot gâché et hocha sa tête. \textit{-Venez à la cuisine, j'ai quelques tartelettes aux fraises de ce matin qui sont encore fraîches.}

Give me a reading comprehension exercise for a student learning French. It should have a subsection for answers.,"Théo regardait l'écran de la télévision avec attention en buvant le chocolat chaud que Maman lui avait apportée. \\
Il regardait un dessin animé sur des enfants qui avaient pris une potion magique et étaient devenus minuscules pour explorer le corps de leur ami malade et découvrir ce qui l'avait mis dans cet état. \\
À la fin du dessin animé, les enfants avaient neutralisé le virus qui avait causé la grippe de leur copain et celui-ci avait fini par guérir. \\

Le concept avait fasciné Théo et il se dit qu'il aurait aimé que ce genre d'excursion puisse être réel. \\
Ses pensées furent interrompues par sa petite sœur qui laissa échapper un soupir triste en posant la poupée avec laquelle elle jouait. \\
Théo la regarda et se demanda si, comme les enfants du dessin animé avaient exploré un corps humain, il serait possible d'explorer l'esprit d'une personne. \\

Dans le dessin animé, le corps du petit garçon était formé de vaisseaux sanguins et d'organes. Théo imagina que ce serait pareil pour tous les corps. \\
Tout le monde a des mains, des jambes, une tête et un cœur après tout, mais est-ce que c'était pareil pour les esprits ? \\
Est-ce que tout le monde pense aux mêmes choses ? \\
Certainement pas ! \\
Théo le savait bien. \\
Son amie Béatrice n'aimait pas les mêmes choses que lui et ils ont souvent des idées différentes. \\
Il avait aussi remarqué que ses camarades de classes avaient de différents intérêts, c'était clair lorsque l'institutrice leur demandait de lire leurs expressions écrites. \\

Théo se laissa emporter par son imagination et essaya de deviner à quoi ressemblerait l'esprit de sa petite sœur. \\
Il se trouva dans un bac à sable géant plein de jouets. \\
Le ciel était rose pâle, il y avait une douce odeur de shampoing à la fraise, et il entendit le son de la musique de la berceuse que sa mère chantait souvent à sa sœur. \\
Il marcha un peu à travers le bac à sable et vit une balançoire dans un coin, des peluches dans un autre, et un camion de glace entre les deux coins. \\

Lorsqu'il avança davantage, il vit des dessins colorés de leur famille que sa sœur avait dessinés et quelques vieux objets comme son doudou et une paire de chaussures qu'elle adorait quand elle était plus jeune et en conclut que cette partie du bac à sable représentait ses souvenirs. \\

\begin{quote}
    \textit{-Eh bien, c'est un endroit drôlement coloré…} se dit-il une fois qu'il avait fait le tour complet.
\end{quote}

En revenant à la réalité, son attention fut capturée par le bruit de froissement du journal que Papa était en train de lire, et il décida d'imaginer à quoi l'esprit de ce dernier ressemblait. \\
Il se trouva dans un endroit fermé aux murs gris. \\
Il y avait un bureau, une chaise, et plein de casiers. \\
L'endroit était calme et silencieux, et il y avait une forte odeur de café dans l'air. \\

Il se demanda distraitement si Papa serait en colère contre lui s'il fouillait dans les tiroirs, puis se rappela que cet endroit est issu de son imagination à lui. \\
Il s'assied sur la chaise et vit qu'il y avait un ordinateur portable fermé, un stylo et des feuilles, un cadre contenant la photo de la famille — le seul élément de couleurs dans la pièce — et une barre de chocolat. \\
Il rigola en voyant le dernier objet et pensa que son père aurait sûrement du chocolat noir dans son bureau au travail. \\

Il se leva pour aller voir ce qu'il y avait dans les tiroirs des casiers et vit qu'il y avait des étiquettes avec les mots : Famille, travail, sport, et plein d'autres sujets écrits sur eux. \\
Le casier de la famille contenait des tiroirs pour chaque membre de la famille et quand il ouvrit le sien, il y trouva des photos de lui lorsqu'il n'était qu'un bébé ainsi que des petites anecdotes écrites sur des feuilles triées dans des dossiers. \\
Il y avait également un tiroir qui contenait les souvenirs de Papa et il y trouva ses photos d'enfance et de jeunesse. \\

\begin{quote}
    \textit{-Quelle bonne mémoire !} murmura-t-il.
\end{quote}

Il savait déjà que son père était très organisé et il se dit que son imagination avait fait un bon travail en composant cet endroit pour refléter l'esprit de son père. \\

Il se mit ensuite à penser à quoi ressemblerait l'esprit de sa jolie Maman et fut transporté dans une grande pièce éclairée par la chaleureuse lumière du soleil. \\
Il y avait une bonne odeur de cookies et de fleurs. \\
Il entendit une très belle musique jouée au piano et vit plein de photos de lui, sa sœur, et son père sur les trois murs de couleur vert pâle, le quatrième étant formé de vitres qui s'étendaient du sol au plafond et qui lui permettaient de voir un grand jardin plein d'arbres et de fleurs. \\

Il retourna son attention vers la pièce et remarqua pour la première fois un meuble en bois plein de livres : des romans, des recueils de poésie, des livres d'histoire, des revues scientifiques, et même des livres pour enfants. \\

\begin{quote}
    \textit{-Je sais déjà ce que je vais lui acheter pour son anniversaire,} dit-il en rigolant.
\end{quote}

Lorsqu'il cessa de rêvasser, Théo pensa qu'il avait formé ces images en se basant sur ce qu'il connaissait déjà de sa famille. \\
Chaque endroit était plein de choses qu'ils aimaient, de couleurs qu'ils portaient, et de sons qu'ils aimaient entendre… ou ne pas entendre, dans le cas de Papa. \\
