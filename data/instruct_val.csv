Give me a reading comprehension exercise for a student learning French. It should have a subsection for answers. It should have multiple steps.,"C'était un beau jour d'été, le soleil transperçait les rideaux de la chambre et on pouvait sentir la douce chaleur du petit matin.\\
Il était difficile de continuer à ignorer le chant des oiseaux et des criquets, l'aboiement du chien et le brouhaha des habitants de la maison.\\
Martin soupira avec regret, et éjecta sa couverture d'un coup de pied.\\
Il bailla et se frotta les yeux avant de quitter son lit.\\
Il jeta un coup d'œil à son réveil et grogna de mécontentement quand il remarqua qu'il s'était réveillé beaucoup plus tôt qu'il n'avait prévu.\\
\\
-- Et moi qui voulais faire la grasse matinée... marmonna-t-il.\\
\\
Il alla faire sa toilette et, avant de se brosser les dents, laissa échapper un sourire moqueur en voyant son reflet.\\
Ses cheveux étaient tout ébouriffés! Il avait même un peu de bave qui dégoulinait du bout de sa bouche.\\
Une fois propre, il se dirigea vers la cuisine pour prendre son petit déjeuner.\\
Il y avait une délicieuse odeur dans toute la maison et, même s'il ne savait pas de quoi il s'agissait, il en voulait une grosse part.\\
\\
En entrant, il entendit sa mère et son grand frère chuchoter puis les vit.\\
\\
-- J'ai économisé assez d'argent pendant les trois dernières années. N'oublie pas que je travaillais aussi pendant l'été, disait Lucas.\\
\\
Il avait la tête inclinée envers Maman et lui jetait un regard suppliant. Maman lui lança un regard douteux avant de retourner son attention vers la poêle.\\
Elle retourna une crêpe avant de poser sa spatule puis questionna Lucas:\\
\\
-- Mais est-ce que tu crois que ça va te suffire pour acheter une voiture? C'est plutôt cher comme engin tu sais...\\
\\
-- Oui! Une petite voiture d'occasion, je n'ai pas besoin d'une voiture neuve dès le début, répondit le grand frère.\\
\\
Lorsque sa mère ne dit rien, Lucas ajouta:\\
\\
-- S'il te plaît Maman, je viens d'avoir mon bac. Je ne vais quand même pas vous demander de me conduire à l'Université tous les jours lors de la rentrée! Et puis, ce n'est pas comme si vous deviez conduire Martin au collège non plus puisqu'il est en vacances. Papa a plus de temps libre maintenant.\\
\\
Maman laissa échapper un soupir puis sourit indulgemment:\\
\\
-- D'accord, je vais en parler à ton père, acquiesça-t-elle, mais la décision lui revient.\\
\\
Lucas hocha la tête avec un sourire et embrassa Maman sur la joue en la remerciant.\\
\\
-- C'est tout ce que je te demande, dit-il.\\
\\
Martin, se doutant de ce qui se passait, décida de confirmer ses soupçons.\\
\\
-- Qu'est-ce qu'il y a? demanda-t-il d'un ton nonchalant, en sortant une boîte de jus du réfrigérateur.\\
\\
-- Bonjour chéri, ton frère veut apprendre à conduire, répondit-elle.\\
\\
Papa avait accepté de donner des cours de conduite à Lucas. Tous les jours, ils sortaient l'après-midi, passaient environ deux heures dehors puis rentraient de mauvaise humeur. Papa et Lucas étaient clairement contrariés après les fameux cours de conduite et Martin se demanda ce qui pouvait bien se passer pour qu'ils soient aussi fâchés, ce qui le poussa à demander de les accompagner pour la prochaine leçon.\\
\\
-- Je m'ennuie, ça me tente de venir avec vous, dit-il en guise d'excuse pendant qu'ils dînaient. Même si ce n'est que pour un jour, ajouta-t-il.\\
\\
Lucas acquiesça d'un haussement d'épaules, et Martin vit Maman fixer lourdement Papa, le poussant à accepter sa demande.\\
\\
C'était décidé, Martin allait partir avec eux!\\
\\
Le lendemain, Martin s'installa sur la banquette arrière, et mit sa ceinture de sécurité.\\
Il observa silencieusement Papa s'asseoir à l'avant et Lucas au volant. Ce dernier ajusta son siège ainsi que les rétroviseurs avant de mettre le contact.\\
Environ une heure et demie après, le trio rentra à la maison.\\
Papa et Lucas étaient fâchés comme les derniers jours et Martin avait l'air pensif. Il avait compris la cause de leur conflit: Papa n'est pas un bon enseignant.\\
Il n'était pas du tout patient, et Lucas n'appréciait pas ses directives et commentaires dits sur un ton irrité.\\
\\
Ayant pitié de son grand frère, Martin décida de lui suggérer une solution d'une manière subtile.\\
\\
Il alla s'asseoir à côté de lui sur le canapé et laissa s'écouler quelques minutes avant de commencer à parler.\\
\\
-- Ce n'est pas vraiment simple de conduire avec Papa, hein? dit-il avec un sourire compatissant.\\
\\
-- Ouais, c'est le moins qu'on puisse dire..., répondit Lucas en levant les yeux au ciel.\\
\\
-- J'avais la même impression lorsqu'il m'apprenait les tables de multiplication au primaire, heureusement que j'avais réglé le problème rapidement.\\
\\
Lucas, intrigué par les paroles de son petit frère, se tortilla un peu avant de glisser un peu plus près de Martin.\\
Il s'éclaircit la gorge et demanda d'une voix basse:\\
\\
-- Et comment t'as fait?\\
\\
Martin le regarda d'un air complice et lui dit:\\
\\
-- J'ai demandé à Maman de le faire à sa place. Elle est beaucoup plus patiente et douce.\\
\\
Lucas lui lança un regard douteux puis fronça les sourcils.\\
\\
-- Je pense que Maman est trop occupée pour m'apprendre à conduire.\\
\\
-- Alors aides-la avec ses corvées, rétorqua Martin.\\
\\
Lucas hocha la tête mais ne dit rien.\\
Il y eut un long moment de silence avant que le frère aîné ne pinçât la joue de Martin, le remerciant pour son conseil.\\
\\
-- Lorsque j'aurai mon permis, je t'emmènerai au parc d'attraction chaque semaine! lui dit-il, excité.\\
\\
Martin s'en doutait mais il sourit quand même, ravi d'avoir pu aider son grand-frère.\\
\\
Quelques jours après, la paix et l'harmonie étaient de retour à la maison.\\
Lucas avait commencé à faire le linge et à laver la vaisselle, accordant plus de temps libre à Maman et par conséquent, plus de temps pour lui apprendre à conduire.\\
\\
Après le changement d'enseignants, Lucas fit beaucoup plus de progrès et s'inscrivit peu après pour passer son permis.\\
Au bout de quelques mois, la famille exprimait sa fierté tandis que Lucas les conduisait à un restaurant pour célébrer sa réussite.\\
\\
-- C'est grâce aux cours de conduite que je lui ai donnés, dit Papa avec un sourire orgueilleux.\\
\\
Les trois autres ne dirent rien mais levèrent les yeux au ciel. Enfin, tous sauf Lucas qui devait garder les yeux sur la route!

Give me a reading comprehension exercise for a student learning German. It should have a subsection for answers. It should have multiple steps.,"In einer kleinen Stadt lebte eine junge Frau namens Julia Schmidt. Sie war sehr intelligent und talentiert. Da sie Sozialpädagogik studierte, war sie auf der Suche nach einem Job in einem Kindergarten. Julia liebte Kinder, und es war schon immer ihr Traumjob gewesen. Deswegen beschloss sie, ihre Bewerbung in einem kleinen Kindergarten abzugeben und dort ihr Glück zu versuchen. Als sie dort ankam, erwartete sie die Direktorin des Kindergartens und begrüßte sie.\\
\textit{In a small town lived a young woman named Julia Schmidt. She was very intelligent and talented. Since she was studying social education, she was looking for a job in a kindergarten. Julia loved children and it had always been her dream job. Therefore, she decided to submit her application in a small kindergarten and try her luck there. When she got there, the director of the kindergarten welcomed her.}\\

Julia war nervös, aber sie wollte den Job. Sie stellte sich vor und hat von ihrer Liebe für Kinder erzählt. Außerdem erwähnte sie, dass sie ein Praktikum abgeschlossen hat. Die Direktorin hörte Julia zu, aber am Ende sagte sie:\\
\textit{Julia was nervous, but she wanted the job. She introduced herself and told of her love for children. She also mentioned that she had completed an internship. The director listened to Julia, but in the end she said:}\\

``Liebe Frau Schmidt, sie sind sehr freundlich und alles was Sie mir heute erzählt haben ist wundervoll. Ich bin mir sicher, dass Sie eine gute Erzieherin sein würden. Ich kann Sie aber nicht einstellen. Es tut mir leid.""\\
\textit{``Dear Mrs. Schmidt, you are very friendly and all you have told me today is wonderful. I'm sure you would be a good educator. I cannot hire you. I am sorry.""}\\

Julia schaute die Frau nervös an.\\
\textit{Julia looked at the woman nervously.}\\

``Können Sie mir bitte sagen, warum Sie dies nicht machen können""?\\
\textit{``Can you please tell me why?""}\\

Die Direktorin antwortete:\\
\textit{The director replied:}\\

``Ich sehe nicht, dass Sie Erfahrung in diesem Job haben. Sie können von ihrer Liebe für Kinder reden, aber ich brauche etwas, was mir wirklich sagt, dass Sie für diese Position gut ausgebildet sind. Verstehen Sie mich nicht falsch und nehmen sie meine Worte nicht persönlich, aber Sie werden wahrscheinlich noch viel arbeiten, bevor Sie als eine kompetente Erzieherin arbeiten können. Ich könnte Sie als Betreuerin einstellen. Das bedeutet, dass Sie auf die Kinder während der Schlafenszeit aufpassen. Eine Erzieherin muss wissen, wie man mit Kindern umgeht und was sie tun dürfen und was nicht. Ich habe das Gefühl, dass Sie immer noch unreif für diese Position sind.""\\
\textit{``I do not see that you have experience in this job. You can talk about your love for children, but I need something that really tells me that you are well educated for this position. Do not get me wrong and do not take my words personally, but you probably will work a lot more before you can work as a competent educator. I could hire you as a caregiver. This means that you take care of the children during bedtime. An educator needs to know how to deal with children and what they are allowed to do and what not. I feel like you are still immature for this position.""}\\

Julia sah die Direktorin mit Enttäuschung an. Sie fühlte, dass sie mehr als bereit für solch einen Job ist. Für sie war dies ein sehr harter Schlag ins Gesicht.\\
\textit{Julia looked at the director with disappointment. She felt that she was more than ready for such a job. For her, this was a very hard slap in the face.}\\

``Frau Schmidt, es tut mir wirklich leid. Sie sind aber sehr jung. Sie haben noch ihr ganzes Leben vor sich und vielleicht bekommen Sie eines Tages diesen Job. Zurzeit ist dies aber unmöglich für Sie. Ich muss dieses Gespräch jetzt zu Ende bringen. Es sind noch andere Kandidaten hier. Viel Glück.""\\
\textit{``Mrs. Schmidt, I'm really sorry. But you are very young. You still have a whole life and maybe one day you will get this job. At the moment this is impossible for you. I have to finish this conversation now. There are other candidates here. Good luck.""}\\

``Ich verstehe. Danke für Ihre Zeit"". Julia hob ihre Tasche auf und ging nach draußen. Sie stieg in den Bus und sie konnte ihre Gefühle nicht kontrollieren. Ihre Wangen waren voller Tränen. Sie fühlte sich gedemütigt und hatte keine Hoffnung mehr. Monate vergingen und sie wusste nicht, wie es weiter gehen soll. Außerdem gab es keine anderen Kindergärten, weil es nicht viele Bewohner in der Stadt gab.""\\
\textit{I understand. Thank you for your time."" Julia lifted her bag and went outside. She got on the bus and she could not control her feelings. Her cheeks were full of tears. She felt humiliated and had no hope. Months passed and she did not know what to do next. In addition, there were no other kindergartens because there were not many residents in the city.}\\

Eines Morgens ging Julia mit Ihrem Hund in den Park. Sie setzte sich auf eine Bank und nahm die Zeitungen aus der Tasche, die sie auf dem Weg gekauft hatte. Auf der ersten Seite sah sie ein Bild des Kindergartens, in dem sie sich beworben hat. In dem Artikel stand, dass die Direktorin den Kindergarten schließen muss, weil sie nicht genug Geld haben, um alles zu finanzieren. Die Erzieher haben schon seit zwei Monaten kein Gehalt bekommen und die Eltern der Kinder sind mit ihrer Arbeit unzufrieden.\\
\textit{One morning Julia went to the park with her dog. She sat down on a bench and took out the newspapers she had bought on the way. On the first page, she saw a picture of the kindergarten she had applied for. The article said that the director had to close the kindergarten because they did not have enough money to finance everything. The educators had not received a salary for two months and the parents of the children were dissatisfied with their work.}\\

Julia war geschockt. Sie wusste, dass sie etwas tun muss. Es handelt sich um Kinder, die Erziehung und Liebe brauchen. Julia ging nach Hause und beschloss, alle Sachen, von ihrem Auto bis hin zu den paar wertvollen Kleinigkeiten zu verkaufen. Das einzige was sie noch übrig hatte, war ihre Wohnung, die fast leer war.\\
\textit{Julia was shocked. She knew she had to do something. These were children who needed education and love. Julia went home and decided to sell everything from her car to the few precious little things she had. The only thing she had left was her apartment, which was almost empty.}\\

Danach ging sie in den Kindergarten und klopfte an die Tür der Direktorin.\\
\textit{Then she went to the kindergarten and knocked on the door of the director.}\\

``Guten Tag. Kann ich bitte mit Ihnen sprechen?""\\
\textit{``Good day. Can I speak with you, please?""}\\

Die Direktorin sah erschöpft aus und sah Julia nicht mal an.\\
\textit{The director looked exhausted and did not even look at Julia.}\\

``Seien Sie bitte schnell. Ich habe nicht sehr viel Zeit. Ich muss dieses Büro räumen."" – sagte die Direktorin.\\
\textit{``Please be quick. I do not have much time. I have to leave this office"", said the director.}\\

``Hier."" Julia legte einen großen Stapel Geld auf den Tisch.\\
\textit{``Here."" Julia put a big stack of money on the table.}\\

Die Direktorin drehte sich zu ihr und sah das Geld.\\
\textit{The director turned to her and saw the money.}\\

``Was ist das?"" – fragte sie.\\
\textit{``What's that?"" - she asked.}\\

``Ich möchte, dass Sie dieses Geld nehmen und die Kosten decken, die Sie haben. Es kann sicher für einige Monate ausreichen. Ich werde bis dann wieder einen Weg finden und dem Kindergarten helfen"" – sagte Julia entschlossen.\\
\textit{``I want you to take this money and cover the costs you have. It can certainly be enough for a few months. I will find a way and help the kindergarten until then,"" said Julia, determined.}\\

Die Direktorin war geschockt. Ihr kamen sogar die Tränen.\\
\textit{The director was shocked. She even cried.}\\

``Wie habe ich das verdient? Ich habe Sie doch vor einigen Monaten abgelehnt und einige Sachen gesagt, die vielleicht zu grob waren.""\\
\textit{``How did I deserve that? I refused you a few months ago and said some things that were perhaps too crude.""}\\

``Das ist wahr. Aber mir sind die Kinder wichtig. Manche von ihnen brauchen diesen Kindergarten mehr, als es sie braucht. Deswegen kann ich es nicht zulassen, dass Sie ihn schließen. Geld sollte kein Problem darstellen. Wenn man Kinder liebevoll behandelt und mit ihnen gut umgeht, dann werden die Eltern auch zufrieden sein und weiterhin ihre Kinder in den Kindergarten schicken. Es ist nicht so kompliziert wie Sie denken.""\\
\textit{``This is true. But the children are important to me. Some of them need this kindergarten more than it needs them. That's why I cannot let you close it. Money does not have to be a problem. If you treat children well and with love, then the parents will be satisfied and continue to send their children to the kindergarten. It's not as complicated as you think.""}\\

Die Direktorin wusste, dass Julia recht hat. Sie sah sie an uns sagte: \\
\textit{The director knew that Julia was right. She looked at her and said:}\\

``Sie haben keine Ahnung, wie dankbar ich bin. Das einzige was ich für sie tun kann, ist sie zu bitten, hier mit mir zu arbeiten. Ich kann ihnen für den Anfang kein großes Gehalt versprechen, aber...""\\
\textit{``You have no idea how grateful I am. The only thing I can do for you is to ask you to work here with me. I cannot promise you a big salary for the beginning, but ...""}\\

Julia unterbrach die Direktorin:\\
\textit{Julia interrupted the director: }\\

``Geld ist mir unwichtig. Ich würde gerne hier arbeiten und ich verspreche Ihnen, dass Sie bald wieder aus dieser Situation herauskommen werden.""\\
\textit{``Money is unimportant to me. I would like to work here and I promise you that you will get out of this situation soon.""}\\

So bekam Julia ihren Traumjob. Ja, die ersten Monate waren hart, aber die Kinder liebten sie. Jeden Tag wuchs die Anzahl der neuen Kinder im Kindergarten und somit auch Julias Liebe für die Kinder.\\
\textit{This is how Julia got her dream job. Yes, the first months were tough, but the kids loved her. The number of new children in the kindergarten grew every day and so did Julia's love for the children.}

Give me a reading comprehension exercise for a student learning French. It should have a subsection for answers.,"Un bel après-midi, trois chatons jouaient près de leurs jeunes propriétaires, qui écoutaient une histoire que leur mère leur racontait. C'était une histoire qui parlait des aventures d'un astronaute, et bien qu'ils ne prêtassent pas beaucoup d'attention à ce qu'elle disait, leur intérêt fut capturé lorsqu'ils entendirent les mots : \textit{voie lactée}.\\

-- La voie lactée ? dit Monocle, une adorable chatonne avec un œil encerclé de gris. Est-ce qu'elle veut dire un chemin couvert complètement de lait ?\\

Oto, le plus jeune d'entre eux, se redressa en imaginant ce qu'elle venait de dire, et Farfouille, leur grand frère, fixa ses yeux avec fascination.\\

-- Tu imagines si cet endroit existait vraiment ?\\

Les trois chatons furent transportés dans un univers fictif, où, dans un vaisseau spatial sombre et étroit, le commandant Farfouille, l'officier scientifique Oto, et la mécanicienne navigante Monocle étaient assis l'un à côté de l'autre. Ils naviguaient leur navette à travers le cosmos, sérieux et silencieux. Leur mission : trouver la voie lactée légendaire et en ramener des échantillons ; ils n'avaient pas l'intention d'échouer.\\

Ils s'arrêtèrent près d'une station spatiale pour s'informer sur le chemin à prendre et téléchargèrent un guide spatial qu'ils chargèrent dans le système de leur vaisseau. Après s'être assurés qu'ils avaient assez de carburant et de provisions, ils reprirent leur vol. Farfouille pilota l'engin, Oto fit des recherches sur leur destination, et Monocle surveilla la condition de la navette.\\

Au bout d'un moment, elle remarqua un point clignotant sur le radar et le signala à ses coéquipiers.\\

-- Doit-on les attaquer, commandant ? demanda-t-elle en se tournant vers Farfouille.\\

-- Hmm... Ce sont nos ennemis jurés, mais ils semblent se diriger vers une autre destination. Mieux vaut nous occuper de nos propres affaires et les ignorer, répondit le commandant sans quitter l'écran du radar des yeux.\\

-- Vous ne pensez pas qu'ils veulent goûter aux délices de la voie lactée eux aussi ? demanda Oto, sa queue frémissante.\\

-- Non, ils visent probablement le fromage de la Lune. Ils ont des goûts bien excentriques, répondit Farfouille.\\

-- N'oubliez pas que ces rats s'en prennent à tout, commandant. Ils viendront probablement vers nous après leur arrêt sur la Lune, ajouta Monocle.\\

-- Si c'est le cas, ils deviendront notre repas du soir, dit Farfouille d'un ton assuré.\\

Oto et Monocle hochèrent la tête et se concentrèrent sur leurs tâches, tandis que le commandant continuait à diriger le vaisseau vers la fameuse rivière de lait flottante, au beau milieu de l'espace. Les trois chatons étaient de fameux aventuriers de l'espace.\\

Farfouille, naturellement curieux et intrépide, aimait explorer l'univers ; Oto aimait apprendre et expérimenter ; et Monocle trouvait leurs aventures amusantes et saisissait toutes les occasions de bricoler à bord de la navette.\\

Une fois arrivés à destination, les trois chatons enfilèrent leurs combinaisons spatiales et descendirent du vaisseau. Ils flottèrent jusqu'à atteindre la rivière de lait miraculeuse. La voie lactée était majestueuse, son lait d'un blanc éclatant dégageait une douce lueur, illuminant l'espace alentour.\\

-- Chat-pristi ! murmura Oto, émerveillé.\\

-- Je n'en crois pas mes yeux, c'est incroyable ! s'exclama Monocle, tout à fait d'accord avec son frère.\\

-- Si seulement on pouvait enlever nos casques ! miaula Farfouille avec regret. On aurait pu goûter au lait directement de la source !\\

Oto tendit la patte pour toucher le lait et constata qu'il était agréablement chaud.\\

-- On dit que ce lait est infusé avec de la poussière d'étoile !\\

-- C'est donc pour ça qu'il brille autant !\\

-- Oui, et je pense que c'est aussi ce qui le garde à bonne température.\\

-- Trêve de bavardage ! les interrompit Farfouille impatiemment. Sortez les aspirateurs et commençons à remplir les réservoirs.\\

Oto et Monocle plongèrent de longs tubes-aspirateurs dans la rivière et commencèrent à pomper le lait vers les réservoirs de leur navette spatiale, tandis que Farfouille surveillait les niveaux. Soudain, Monocle aperçut un étrange signal sur son radar portable.\\

-- On dirait qu'un vaisseau s'approche à toute vitesse !\\

-- Restez ici, je vais vérifier sur le radar de bord. Je suis sûr que ce n'est rien, dit Farfouille.\\

Quelques instants plus tard, il ordonna à Oto et Monocle de retourner à bord du vaisseau.\\

-- C'est la navette des rats, ils viennent nous attaquer !\\

Lorsque les rongeurs approchèrent, Farfouille visa et commença à tirer sur eux avec les armes laser de la navette.\\

-- Monocle, tâche d'esquiver leurs attaques pendant qu'Oto et moi ripostons, ordonna Farfouille.\\

Comment osaient ces vermines les attaquer, et près de la voie lactée sacrée en plus ! Il n'était pas question de les laisser contaminer cette rivière de lait légendaire.\\

Après une longue bataille, les rats battirent en retraite, et la voie lactée fut sauvée par les courageux chatons de l'espace.\\

-- Mais qu'est-ce qu'ils font ? demanda une voix.\\

Les chatons relevèrent la tête et virent leurs jeunes propriétaires les regarder avec confusion. Monocle sortit de la boîte en carton où ils jouaient et se dirigea vers sa jeune humaine. Farfouille et Oto firent de même, et les trois chatons ronronnèrent sous les caresses affectueuses de leurs amis humains.\\

-- Allez, rentrons ! Je suis sûre qu'ils ont faim, donnons-leur un peu de lait, dit l'humaine de Monocle à ses frères.

Give me a reading comprehension exercise for a student learning French. It should have a subsection for answers.,"Stéphanie fit tambouriner ses doigts sur son bureau, les yeux fixés sur la feuille blanche qui était posée au centre avec un stylo au-dessus. \\
\textit{-Mais qu'est-ce que je dois choisir ?} se demanda-t-elle en se penchant en arrière sur sa chaise avec un soupir. \\
Elle devait écrire un texte dans lequel elle décrit sa saison préférée et explique pourquoi elle l'aime tellement. C'était un devoir que leur enseignant leur avait demandé de faire et de rendre le lendemain. \\
Pour Stéfy, les expressions écrites étaient faciles et amusantes à faire, d'ailleurs c'était une des rares choses qu'elle aimait avoir comme devoir. \\
Le seul problème était qu'elle ne savait pas quoi choisir, elle aimait toutes les saisons et n'avait pas une qu'elle préférait. N'était-ce pas le but d'avoir quatre saisons en rotation, après tout, d'avoir l'occasion et le plaisir de les vivre toutes ? \\

Elle aimait la progression naturelle des saisons, elle aimait le froid et la pluie de l'hiver, les couleurs du printemps, la joie de l'été et la douceur de l'automne. \\
Après quelques moments de réflexion, elle décida de demander à ses parents quelle était leur saison préférée en espérant que ça l'aiderait à décider. \\
Papa avait dit qu'il aimait l'hiver et lorsque Stéfy lui avait demandé pourquoi pas les autres saisons, il avait dit que son allergie au pollen rendait le printemps pénible, qu'il y avait trop de mouches en automne et qu'il faisait trop chaud pendant l'été.\\
Maman avait choisi l'été simplement parce qu'elle pouvait faire la grasse matinée et ne devait pas se lever tôt pour préparer le petit déjeuner et conduire sa fille à l'école. \\

Pas vraiment convaincue par les raisons de ses parents, qui semblaient être plus pratiques qu'amusantes, Stéphanie alla parler avec ses amis. \\
Tous sauf un lui avaient dit qu'ils préféraient l'été parce que c'est la saison des vacances et qu'ils pouvaient jouer à volonté, n'avaient pas de devoirs, et en plus ils pouvaient aller à la plage. \\
Le dernier lui avait dit qu'il aimait l'automne parce qu'il aimait voir les feuilles des arbres changer de couleur et le vol des oiseaux qui partent en migration vers des régions plus chaudes. \\
Lorsqu'il lui demanda pourquoi elle voulait savoir, elle lui expliqua son problème. \\

\begin{quote}
\textit{-Je vois, alors ton souci c'est que tu ne peux pas faire un choix, c'est ça ?}\\
\textit{-Oui.}\\
\textit{-Alors, pourquoi n'écris-tu pas un texte qui contient toutes les saisons ? Une saison quatre-en-un en quelque sorte,} suggéra-t-il.
\end{quote}

Stéphanie tapota son doigt sur son menton et prit quelques instants pour penser à l'idée de son ami. \\
Ce n'était pas mal comme suggestion et l'enseignant n'avait pas précisé de règles qui pouvaient l'empêcher de le faire. Et puis, plus elle y pensait, plus elle avait envie de le faire, elle trouvait ça amusant d'imaginer une saison qui regroupe les quatre qui existent. \\
Elle remercia son ami puis rentra chez elle pour commencer son travail. \\

Elle s'assied sur sa chaise de bureau, ferma les yeux et commença à imaginer son monde où les saisons étaient fusionnées en une seule. \\
Elle imagina une belle forêt où les arbres avaient un feuillage tantôt vert de printemps, tantôt doré d'automne, certains arbres étaient recouverts de neige et d'autres portaient des fruits mûrs. \\
On y entendait le chant des oiseaux et des criquets, et on pouvait voir des abeilles et des papillons butiner les fleurs et les baies sur les buissons. Il ne faisait ni trop froid, ni trop chaud.\\

Stéphanie ouvrit soudainement les yeux et secoua la tête. \\
\begin{quote}
\textit{-Non, ce n'est pas vraiment excitant de mélanger le tout…} murmura-t-elle.
\end{quote}

Elle prit une pause et alla à la cuisine pour prendre son goûter et son regard fut capturé par l'assiette compartimentée qui contenait des condiments : il y avait de la mayonnaise, du ketchup, de la moutarde et du houmous. \\
En la regardant, Stéfy se demanda à quoi ressemblerait sa forêt imaginaire si elle était divisée comme cette assiette, avec les saisons à la place des condiments. \\

Elle s'assied sur l'une des chaises de la cuisine et se replongea dans son monde.\\
Si elle pouvait voir la forêt de haut, elle aurait pu remarquer que celle-ci avait des bordures distinctes cette fois : on pouvait clairement voir où une partie se termine pour laisser place à une autre. \\
Elle commença à explorer cet endroit et ne tarda pas à constater qu'elle était dans la partie où le printemps dominait. Il y avait plein de couleurs, l'air était frais et les sons des animaux animaient l'endroit. \\
Elle vit un écureuil courir d'un arbre à un autre et le suivit. \\

Lorsqu'elle le vit grimper, son attention fut détournée vers les pommes suspendues sur une branche et elle sentit un changement subtil dans la température de l'air. \\
\begin{quote}
\textit{-Ah, je vois, c'est l'été ici…} dit-elle avant de continuer en avant.

Elle leva le bras pour se protéger les yeux des rayons de soleil qui transperçaient les feuilles des arbres, dessinant des motifs mystérieux avec des ombres et des lumières sur le sol. Un vent soudain la fit marcher plus rapidement et elle baissa son bras lorsqu'elle entendit le son des feuilles mortes sur lesquelles elle marchait. \\
Les arbres étaient à présent vêtus de feuilles jaunes, oranges, rouges et marrons, et elle sentit une odeur agréable de terre humide et de champignons. \\
Elle se pencha au bord d'une rivière et retira sa main aussitôt qu'elle l'étendit pour toucher l'eau. Elle regarda l'autre côté de la rivière et vit que les arbres étaient dévêtus de leurs feuillages et recouverts d'une épaisse couche de neige. \\

Lorsqu'elle ouvrit les yeux, elle sourit et prit une brioche au chocolat avant de retourner dans sa chambre pour transformer ses pensées en mots. \\

Le lendemain, lorsqu'elle lut son expression écrite, toute la classe, y compris son enseignant, l'applaudit chaleureusement, et tout le monde exprima son envie de visiter sa forêt quatre-saisons.

It should have a subsection for answers.,"Ein träger alter Mann lebte mit seinem Sohn, seiner Schwiegertochter und seinem vierjährigen Enkel. Die Hände des alten Mannes zitterten, seine Sicht war schwach und seine Beine dienten ihm nicht sehr gut.\\ 
\textit{A sluggish old man lived with his son, daughter in law, and four-year-old grandson. The old man's hands shivered, his vision was weak, and his legs did not serve him very well.}\\ 

Wenn die Familie sich zum Essen an den Tisch setzte, würden die zitternden Hände des Großvaters und die geringe Sehkraft das Essen sehr schwierig und unangenehm machen. \\
\textit{When the family would sit down at the table to eat, the grandfather’s shaking hands and low vision would make the meal very difficult and unpleasant.} \\

Das Essen würde vom Löffel auf den Boden fallen. \\
\textit{The food would fall from the spoon to the floor. }\\

Wenn er das Glas heben wollte, würde die Milch auf den Tisch fallen. \\
\textit{If he wanted to get a glass, the milk would go down on the table.} \\

Sein Sohn und seine Schwiegertochter begannen wütend zu werden. \\
\textit{His son and daughter in law started to get angry.} \\

“Wir müssen etwas mit unserem Großvater machen”, sagte der Sohn eines Tages. \\
\textit{“We have to do something with our grandfather,” said the son one day.} \\

Ich habe genug von der verschütteten Milch, lautem Essen und Essen auf dem Boden. \\
\textit{I have enough of the spilled milk, loud eating and food on the floor.”} \\

Der Sohn und die Schwiegertochter stellten einen kleinen Tisch in die Ecke des Zimmers auf. \\
\textit{The son and daughter in law set up a small table in the corner of the room.} \\

Der Großvater aß dort, während der Rest der Familie das Essen genoss. \\
\textit{The grandfather was eating there, while the rest of the family enjoyed the meal.} \\

Als der Großvater ein paar Schalen zerbrach, wurde sein Essen in einer Holzschale serviert. \\
\textit{After the grandfather had broken a few bowls, his food was served in a wooden bowl. }\\

Wenn die Familie manchmal den Großvater ansah, sahen sie manchmal die Tränen in seinen Augen, wenn er allein da saß. \\
\textit{When the family looked at the grandfather, they would sometimes see the tears in his eyes as he sat there alone.} \\

Dennoch, die einzigen Worte, die das junge Paar für ihn hatte, waren Worte der Wut, wenn etwas auf den Boden fiel. \\
\textit{Nevertheless, the only words the young couple had for him were words of anger if something fell to the floor.} \\

Der vierjährige Enkel sah schweigend zu. \\
\textit{The four-year-old grandson looked in silence. }\\

Eines Abends vor dem Essen sah sein Vater seinen kleinen Sohn mit Holzstücken spielen. \\
\textit{One evening before a meal, his father saw his little son playing with pieces of wood.} \\

Er fragte ihn: “Was machst du?” \\
\textit{He asked him, “What are you doing?” }\\

Der Junge antwortete: “Oh, ich mache kleine Schalen aus Holz für dich und Mutter, damit ihr etwas habt, woraus ihr essen könnt, wenn ich groß bin.” \\
\textit{The boy replied, “Oh, I’m making small wooden pans for you and Mom to have something to eat from when I grow up.” }\\

Der Junge lächelte und fuhr mit seiner Arbeit fort. \\
\textit{The boy smiled and continued with his job. }\\

Die Eltern waren sprachlos, und Tränen liefen über ihre Wangen. \\
\textit{The parents were left speechless and their tears began to run down their cheeks.} \\

Obwohl sie kein Wort sagten, wussten beide, was jetzt zu tun war. \\

Bis zum Ende seines Lebens aß der alte Mann mit seiner Familie. \\
\textit{By the end of his life, the old man ate with his family.} \\

Give me a reading comprehension exercise for a student learning French. It should have a subsection for answers.,"En un jour chaud et ensoleillé, tandis que les criquets chantaient et que les fourmis montaient en queue sur un arbre, Jacob était à quatre pattes dans le petit jardin de sa maison et cherchait sans relâche dans l'herbe en quête du trèfle à quatre feuilles légendaire. \\
Le but principal de sa recherche était de s'attribuer la chance qui venait de l'objet, comme tout le monde. \\
Il ne croyait pas qu'il allait trouver facilement un fer à cheval dans la ville et il ne voulait certainement pas avoir la patte d'un lapin ! Quel genre de personne sans cœur pourrait faire ça à un pauvre lapin ?! \\
Et donc, sa seule option était un trèfle à quatre feuilles. S'il arrivait à l'avoir, il aurait de la chance et s'il avait de la chance, tout irait à merveille dans sa vie. \\

Le seul problème était que, malgré sa recherche méticuleuse, il n'arrivait pas à trouver l'objet en question. \\
Il commençait à se sentir frustré après une demi-heure de recherche et il considérait sérieusement d'abandonner sa tâche. \\
\textit{-Je commence à croire qu'ils n'ont jamais existé...} murmura-t-il de manière grincheuse en se tapotant les mains pour se débarrasser de la terre avec un souffle. \\

\textit{-Qu'est-ce qui te fait marmonner comme ça, petit ?} La voix de sa grande sœur survint de derrière lui, le faisant sursauter. \\
\textit{-Leah ! Ne viens pas derrière les gens ainsi !} la gronda-t-il en fronçant les sourcils. \\
\textit{-Pardon,} dit-elle en rigolant avant de s'asseoir sur l'herbe à côté de lui. \\
\textit{-Alors, pourquoi es-tu si contrarié ?} demanda-t-elle en lui pinçant la joue avant qu'il ne tape sa main. \\

Il laissa échapper un souffle avec un regard misérable et se massa la tempe pour se calmer. \\
\textit{-J'ai cherché partout à travers le jardin pour trouver un trèfle à quatre feuilles mais apparemment, tous les trèfles ici n'ont que trois feuilles.} \\

\textit{-Je vois,} Leah dit en mettant un bras sur ses genoux avant de mettre son menton dessus. \\
\textit{-Et pourquoi as-tu besoin d'en trouver un à quatre feuilles ?} \\

\textit{-Pour avoir de la chance, bien sûr. Pourquoi d'autre ?} dit-il en froissant son front. \\
\textit{-Et bien, pourquoi as-tu besoin d'avoir de la chance ?} \\
Est-ce qu'elle jouait l'idiote exprès ? Il savait à quel point elle était intelligente, alors elle était sûrement en train de le taquiner. \\
Jacob n'était pas d'humeur à se faire taquiner ! \\

\textit{-Et bien pour tout ! La chance nous aide avec tout, n'est-ce pas ? Ça rend tout plus facile et meilleur ! Je serai meilleur en football et j'aurai de meilleures notes et je gagnerai chaque partie de jeux vidéo que je jouerai !} expliqua-t-il en agitant ses mains un peu partout. \\

Sa grande sœur rigola et lui ébouriffa les cheveux. \\
\textit{-Calme-toi, mon grand. Je comprends.} \\
\textit{-Alors tu vois pourquoi j'ai besoin de le trouver.} \\

\textit{-Je ne crois pas que la chance marche autant que tu le penses, tu sais ?} Leah dit. \\
Jacob souffla et roula des yeux. \\
\textit{-Ouais, c'est ça. Elle ne savait rien... Les adultes ne savaient rien sur ses problèmes.} \\

\textit{-Non, je suis sérieuse. Est-ce que tu connais quelqu'un qui a réussi dans sa vie en comptant sur la chance ?} lui demanda-t-elle en arquant ses sourcils. \\
\textit{-Et bien... non, mais...} Il prit un moment pour penser à un argument mais ne pouvait pas en avoir un. \\

\textit{-Tu vois ? La majorité des gens qui ont accompli leurs buts comptent sur autre chose. Peux-tu deviner ce que c'est ?} demanda-t-elle avec un sourire taquin. \\
\textit{-Les miracles ?} Jacob répondit avec sarcasme, la faisant rire. \\
\textit{-Non, petit malin ! Le travail. Les gens travaillent dur pour réaliser leurs rêves. Ils s'améliorent dans leur métier en travaillant dur et en s'appliquant et ils amassent de l'expérience et du savoir qui les aideraient par la suite à travailler plus rapidement et de façon meilleure,} expliqua-t-elle. \\

\textit{-Ah, bon ? Donne-moi un exemple.} Le petit garçon la défia en croisant les bras. \\
\textit{-Toi ! Tu te rappelles à quel point tu étais faible en Histoire ?} Jacob fit une grimace en pensant à ses vieilles notes en Histoire. \\
Il détestait la matière et avait refusé de la réviser. \\

Mais, il était arrivé à s'y améliorer et il avait trouvé une manière de mémoriser ses leçons de manière efficace quand il s'était décidé à le faire et avec l'aide de Leah. \\
Maintenant, l'Histoire était devenue l'une de ses matières préférées et il n'avait que de bonnes notes. \\

\textit{-D'accord. Quoi d'autre ?} demanda-t-il, pas très convaincu. \\
Leah se tourna pour regarder la maison puis autour d'elle pour s'assurer que personne d'autre que Jacob ne pouvait l'entendre. \\
\textit{-Tu te souviens à quel point Maman était mauvaise en jardinage ?} \\

Jacob rigola en pensant à toutes les pauvres plantes que sa mère avait noyées en les arrosant plus qu'il ne fallait. \\
\textit{-Elle a fait beaucoup de progrès...} dit-il en regardant les rosiers qui étaient en pleine floraison grâce aux soins de sa mère. \\

\textit{-Et tout le monde sait que j'étais très mauvaise en basketball quand je venais tout juste de commencer. Maintenant, regarde-moi ! Après des mois et des mois de travail dur, je suis devenue capitaine de mon équipe à l'école !} Leah dit avec un sourire fier. \\

\textit{-C'est vrai. Papa n'arrête pas de parler de tes exploits,} Jacob dit avec un sourire taquin. \\
\textit{-Tu vois ? En réalité, tout le monde peut devenir excellent dans n'importe quel domaine. Tu es devenu meilleur en Histoire après avoir fait des efforts. Maman est devenue meilleure en jardinage parce qu'elle a refusé d'abandonner malgré toutes les plantes qu'elle avait tuées et moi, je suis devenue meilleure en basketball après des heures et des heures d'entraînement.} \\

\textit{Toute personne qui est bonne dans un domaine était mauvaise au début et s'est seulement améliorée après s'être exercée et avoir travaillé dur. La chance est une jolie chose mais si tout le monde comptait sur elle, on n'aurait pas de progrès dans tous les domaines.} \\

Jacob hocha la tête et sourit. \\
\textit{-Je comprends. Et puis qui a besoin de chance ? Je peux tout faire tout seul.} \\

\textit{-Et si tu as des soucis, tu peux toujours demander de l'aide,} Leah lui rappela avec un sourire. \\
Jacob sourit et la regarda d'un air penaud. \\
\textit{-Alors... tu veux bien m'aider pour trouver le trèfle à quatre feuilles...? Pas pour avoir de la chance ! Juste parce que je pense que ce serait cool d'en trouver un !} \\

Leah roula les yeux au ciel avec une expression affectueuse et lui sourit avant que les deux ne recommencent à chercher le fameux objet porteur de chance.

Give me a combination of a word problem and an arithmetic exercise for a 6th grade student learning mathematics. It should be an exercise on ratios. It should be a with Answer.,"The ratio of the number of Cynthia's posters to the number of Laura's posters was \( 3 : 4 \). Cynthia had 24 fewer posters than Laura. Later, Laura gave 36 of her posters away to her brother. Find the new ratio of the number of Cynthia's posters to the number of Laura's posters.

\subsection*{Answers}
Let the number of Cynthia's posters be \( 3x \) and Laura's posters be \( 4x \). According to the problem, we have:
\[
3x = 4x - 24
\]
Solving for \( x \):
\[
x = 24
\]
Thus, Cynthia has \( 3 \times 24 = 72 \) posters and Laura has \( 4 \times 24 = 96 \) posters. After Laura gives away 36 posters, she has \( 96 - 36 = 60 \) posters. The new ratio of Cynthia's posters to Laura's posters is:
\[
\frac{72}{60} = \frac{12}{10} = \frac{6}{5}
\]
The new ratio is \( 6 : 5 \)."

Give me a reading comprehension exercise for a student learning French. It should have a subsection for answers.,"Jules regardait son père avec de grands yeux pétillants pendant qu'il lui expliquait l'intérêt d'avoir de l'argent de poche avant de lui donner ce qu'il considérait être une petite somme. \\
Mais, pour le petit garçon qui n'avait jamais tenu autant d'argent, c'était une vraie fortune. \\
\textit{-Je suis riche…} murmura-t-il. \\
\textit{-Et bien…} Son père n'avait pas le cœur de le contredire et se suffit de lui sourire. \\
\textit{-Je vais pouvoir acheter tant de choses ! Vite, Papa, prends une feuille et fais une liste de tout ce que je te dis !} Jules tira son père par la manche et lui demanda de s'asseoir sur sa chaise de bureau. \\
Papa céda à sa demande et prit un stylo et une feuille blanche. \\
\textit{-Je t'écoute.} lui dit-il. \\
\textit{-Euh, d'accord, alors… la première chose que je veux acheter est une petite voiture téléguidée.} Papa prit note et retourna son regard vers Jules. \\
\textit{-Je vais aussi acheter une machine à glace, un nouveau vélo, des jeux vidéo et un ballon de football.} Jules attendit que son père finisse de noter tout ça puis énuméra un tas d'autres choses. \\
Au bout d'une demi-heure, Papa avait deux feuilles remplies d'objets que son fils voulait s'acheter avec son argent de poche. \\
Il sourit avec amusement et se demanda comment il allait dire à son petit garçon que l'argent qu'il lui avait donné n'allait pas lui suffire pour s'acheter toutes ces choses. \\
Il regarda Jules courir au meuble à chaussures et mettre ses petites baskets. \\
\textit{-Allez, viens mettre tes chaussures !} Il lui dit avec impatience. \textit{Tu dois me conduire au centre commercial pour que je puisse acheter mes affaires.} \\
\textit{-Pas encore.} dit Papa. \\
Jules fronça les sourcils, mécontent. \\
\textit{-Pourquoi pas ?} \\
\textit{-Viens là, mon chéri.} Papa lui demanda en tapotant ses genoux et Jules courut s'y installer. \\
\textit{-Je sais que tu es excité et content de recevoir ta première allocation d'argent de poche, mais je dois te dire que l'argent que tu as ne va pas te suffire pour acheter tout ce que nous avons noté. En fait, il ne te suffira même pas pour acheter quoi que ce soit dans ta liste prestigieuse.} \\

Déçu, Jules baissa la tête et bouda. Comment pouvait-papa lui dire une chose pareille ?! Et pourquoi ne l'avait-il pas dit avant ? \\
\textit{-Regarde-moi.} Papa demanda doucement. \\
\textit{-Tu ne peux pas acheter quelque chose de cher avec, mais tu peux en économiser une partie et au bout de quelques mois tu vas pouvoir t'acheter une des choses dans ta liste. La voiture, par exemple.} \\
\textit{-Une partie ?} Jules le regarda avec confusion. \\
\textit{-Tu ne crois pas qu'il serait mieux pour moi d'économiser tout mon argent de poche ?} \\
Papa hocha la tête. \\
\textit{-Tu peux le faire mais… ne voudrais-tu pas en dépenser une partie ? T'acheter des bonbons pour toi et tes amis ? Il est bien d'avoir plein de jouets mais au bout d'un moment tu vas t'en lasser et vouloir sortir jouer avec tes copains dehors.} \\

Jules y pensa un petit moment, puis dit à son père qu'il ne voulait pas le faire. \\
\textit{-Maman dit toujours que les bonbons causent des caries de toute façon. Je ne veux pas que mes dents tombent ni ceux de mes amis.} \\
Papa soupira, secoua la tête avec amusement, puis lui dit : \\
\textit{-D'accord, c'est comme tu veux.} Il lui offrit par la suite une petite tirelire en forme de tortue et lui expliqua qu'elle lui servirait à garder son argent. \\
\textit{-Mais sache qu'une fois que tu y mets de l'argent, tu ne peux plus le reprendre parce qu'il n'y a pas moyen de l'ouvrir.} \\
\textit{-Comment je vais faire lorsque j'en ai assez pour acheter ma voiture alors ?} \\
\textit{-Eh bien, tu vas la briser !} \\

Jules regarda son père avec de grands yeux surpris. \\
\textit{-Tu veux que je brise la tortue ?} \\
Papa rigola un peu et l'assura que c'est ainsi que la plupart des tirelires marchent. \\
\textit{-La prochaine fois je t'offrirai une avec un cadenas, comme ça tu vas pouvoir la garder.} lui promit-il. \\

Après quelques jours, lorsqu'il jouait avec ses deux meilleurs amis, Jules vit un camion de glace se garer près d'eux. \\
Ses deux copains sortirent leur argent et achetèrent des cornets qu'ils partagèrent avec lui. \\
Il se sentit un peu coupable de ne pas avoir voulu garder une partie de son argent pour leur rendre la pareille et le dit à son père. \\
\textit{-Eh bien, on ne peut pas retirer de l'argent de ta tirelire mais je peux te donner une petite avance sur ton allocation du mois prochain.} \\
\textit{-Vraiment ?} \\
\textit{-Oui, mais tu dois d'abord prouver que tu le mérites. Tu dois gagner ton argent.} \\

\textit{-Qu'est-ce que je dois faire ?} le petit garçon demanda. \\
\textit{-Sois un bon petit garçon, aide Maman en rangeant ta chambre et fais tes devoirs. Ne fais pas de bêtises et ne te dispute pas avec tes camarades de garderie et puis c'est tout !} Papa dit avec un sourire encourageant. \\
\textit{-D'accord.} dit Jules. \textit{Et quand est-ce que je peux avoir l'argent ?} \\
\textit{-Dans trois jours.} \\
\textit{-Marché conclu !} Papa rigola et surveilla son fils pendant les jours qui suivirent. \\

Il était content de voir Jules apprendre à être responsable avec son argent et à devenir plus généreux. \\
Lorsque trois mois s'écoulèrent, il décida de lui donner une augmentation. \\
\textit{-Pourquoi ?} demanda Jules. \\
\textit{-Parce que tu l'as mérité. Tu as été gentil avec ton institutrice et tes camarades et tu as gardé ta chambre bien propre et tu m'aides moi et Maman en donnant des bains au chien et en arrosant les plantes du jardin. Tu as fait du bon travail et c'est ta récompense.} \\

Content, Jules remercia son père et acheta une tablette de chocolat qu'il partagea avec ses parents. \\
Il avait réalisé qu'il ne devait pas être riche pour partager des choses avec ses amis et sa famille et que cela le rendait plus heureux que toutes les voitures téléguidées au monde.

Il regardait un dessin animé sur des enfants qui avaient pris une potion magique et étaient devenus minuscules pour explorer le corps de leur ami malade et découvrir ce qui l'avait mis dans cet état. \\
À la fin du dessin animé, les enfants avaient neutralisé le virus qui avait causé la grippe de leur copain et celui-ci avait fini par guérir. \\

Le concept avait fasciné Théo et il se dit qu'il aurait aimé que ce genre d'excursion puisse être réel. \\
Ses pensées furent interrompues par sa petite sœur qui laissa échapper un soupir triste en posant la poupée avec laquelle elle jouait. \\
Théo la regarda et se demanda si, comme les enfants du dessin animé avaient exploré un corps humain, il serait possible d'explorer l'esprit d'une personne. \\

Dans le dessin animé, le corps du petit garçon était formé de vaisseaux sanguins et d'organes. Théo imagina que ce serait pareil pour tous les corps. \\
Tout le monde a des mains, des jambes, une tête et un cœur après tout, mais est-ce que c'était pareil pour les esprits ? \\
Est-ce que tout le monde pense aux mêmes choses ? \\
Certainement pas ! \\
Théo le savait bien. \\
Son amie Béatrice n'aimait pas les mêmes choses que lui et ils ont souvent des idées différentes. \\
Il avait aussi remarqué que ses camarades de classes avaient de différents intérêts, c'était clair lorsque l'institutrice leur demandait de lire leurs expressions écrites. \\

Théo se laissa emporter par son imagination et essaya de deviner à quoi ressemblerait l'esprit de sa petite sœur. \\
Il se trouva dans un bac à sable géant plein de jouets. \\
Le ciel était rose pâle, il y avait une douce odeur de shampoing à la fraise, et il entendit le son de la musique de la berceuse que sa mère chantait souvent à sa sœur. \\
Il marcha un peu à travers le bac à sable et vit une balançoire dans un coin, des peluches dans un autre, et un camion de glace entre les deux coins. \\

Lorsqu'il avança davantage, il vit des dessins colorés de leur famille que sa sœur avait dessinés et quelques vieux objets comme son doudou et une paire de chaussures qu'elle adorait quand elle était plus jeune et en conclut que cette partie du bac à sable représentait ses souvenirs. \\

\begin{quote}

En revenant à la réalité, son attention fut capturée par le bruit de froissement du journal que Papa était en train de lire, et il décida d'imaginer à quoi l'esprit de ce dernier ressemblait. \\

Il y avait un bureau, une chaise, et plein de casiers. \\
L'endroit était calme et silencieux, et il y avait une forte odeur de café dans l'air. \\

Il se demanda distraitement si Papa serait en colère contre lui s'il fouillait dans les tiroirs, puis se rappela que cet endroit est issu de son imagination à lui. \\
Il s'assied sur la chaise et vit qu'il y avait un ordinateur portable fermé, un stylo et des feuilles, un cadre contenant la photo de la famille — le seul élément de couleurs dans la pièce — et une barre de chocolat. \\
Il rigola en voyant le dernier objet et pensa que son père aurait sûrement du chocolat noir dans son bureau au travail. \\

Il se leva pour aller voir ce qu'il y avait dans les tiroirs des casiers et vit qu'il y avait des étiquettes avec les mots : Famille, travail, sport, et plein d'autres sujets écrits sur eux. \\
Le casier de la famille contenait des tiroirs pour chaque membre de la famille et quand il ouvrit le sien, il y trouva des photos de lui lorsqu'il n'était qu'un bébé ainsi que des petites anecdotes écrites sur des feuilles triées dans des dossiers. \\
Il y avait également un tiroir qui contenait les souvenirs de Papa et il y trouva ses photos d'enfance et de jeunesse. \\

\begin{quote}
    \textit{-Quelle bonne mémoire !} murmura-t-il.
\end{quote}

Il savait déjà que son père était très organisé et il se dit que son imagination avait fait un bon travail en composant cet endroit pour refléter l'esprit de son père. \\

Il se mit ensuite à penser à quoi ressemblerait l'esprit de sa jolie Maman et fut transporté dans une grande pièce éclairée par la chaleureuse lumière du soleil. \\
Il y avait une bonne odeur de cookies et de fleurs. \\
Il entendit une très belle musique jouée au piano et vit plein de photos de lui, sa sœur, et son père sur les trois murs de couleur vert pâle, le quatrième étant formé de vitres qui s'étendaient du sol au plafond et qui lui permettaient de voir un grand jardin plein d'arbres et de fleurs. \\

Il retourna son attention vers la pièce et remarqua pour la première fois un meuble en bois plein de livres : des romans, des recueils de poésie, des livres d'histoire, des revues scientifiques, et même des livres pour enfants. \\

\begin{quote}
    \textit{-Je sais déjà ce que je vais lui acheter pour son anniversaire,} dit-il en rigolant.
\end{quote}

Lorsqu'il cessa de rêvasser, Théo pensa qu'il avait formé ces images en se basant sur ce qu'il connaissait déjà de sa famille. \\
Chaque endroit était plein de choses qu'ils aimaient, de couleurs qu'ils portaient, et de sons qu'ils aimaient entendre… ou ne pas entendre, dans le cas de Papa. \\
Mais… pensa-t-il, à quoi peut bien ressembler mon esprit à moi ?

Give me a reading comprehension exercise for a student learning French. It should have a subsection for answers.,"Deux chevaliers étaient dans le champ de bataille, avec seulement la lumière aveuglante du soleil comme leur témoin. Les deux se tenaient en position de combat et s'encerclaient. Peu de temps s'écoula avant que l'un d'eux n'attaqua l'autre avec un cri de guerre. Il se lança sur son adversaire qui bloqua son épée avec la sienne. \textit{Claque !} Seuls les bruits de fer battant le fer pouvaient s'entendre tandis que les deux s'affrontèrent. \\

Ils firent beaucoup d'efforts pour coordonner leurs mouvements, levant leurs armes pour attaquer et basculant leurs corps pour esquiver les coups de l'autre. Ce n'était que lorsque l'un d'eux exécuta un mouvement assez fort pour désarmer son adversaire que la bataille se termina. Le vainqueur se tint avec son épée pointée vers son ennemi qui avait levé les mains en l'air en signe de soumission puis baissa son arme. \\

Les deux chevaliers enlevèrent leurs casques et se serrèrent la main avec un sourire. \textit{-C'était un bel effort,} le gagnant dit. \textit{-Mais tu dois t'entraîner davantage.} Le perdant lui tira la langue et lui dit qu'il le savait déjà. \\

\textit{-Grand frère !} Un petit garçon courut soudainement vers le chevalier vainqueur. \textit{-Tu as encore gagné ! Tu es le meilleur !} Son grand frère lui ébouriffa les cheveux avant de le prendre dans ses bras puis le mit sur ses épaules. \textit{-Oui, Edward et tu vas être comme moi quand tu seras plus grand, d'ailleurs, tu seras encore meilleur que moi !} \\

Les deux allèrent à l'intérieur du château pour voir s'ils pourraient avoir quelque chose à grignoter avant le déjeuner et en faisant leur chemin vers la cuisine, ils entendirent les hauts cris de la cuisinière. \textit{-Qui était-ce ? Lequel d'entre vous a osé voler l'agneau ?} Elle hurla sur trois gardes et deux femmes de chambre. Aucun d'eux ne répondit et ils échangèrent des expressions inquiètes entre eux. \\

Le chevalier et son petit frère entrèrent dans la cuisine et quand la cuisinière les vit, son visage s'éclaira. \textit{-Ah ! Sire Maximilian ! Je suis heureuse de vous voir. Veuillez dire à ces mécréants d'admettre lequel d'eux a volé mon gigot d'agneau. Il était censé être servi sur la table du roi pour le dîner de ce soir !} Dit-elle en jetant un regard plein de réprimande sur les femmes de chambre et les gardes qui étaient là-bas. \\

\textit{-Vous... avez perdu un gigot d'agneau ?} Maximilian demanda en arquant un sourcil. \\

\textit{-Mais bien sûr que non ! Qui pourrait bien perdre un objet aussi large ? Je ne l'ai pas perdu. Il a été volé, évidement !} La cuisinière répondit en roulant les yeux au plafond. \\

Maximilian hocha la tête et s'excusa de l'avoir mal compris. \textit{-Quand l'avez-vous vu la dernière fois ?} Demanda-t-il. \\

\textit{-Il était sous la table, en train de mariner tranquillement dans une grande marmite avec des herbes et des épices. Je l'ai couvert avec ce torchon.} Elle lui montra un grand morceau de tissu. \textit{Et quand je suis retournée à la cuisine, il n'était plus là ! La marmite était vide et seul le torchon était sur la table.} Lui dit-elle avec un soupir misérable. \\

\textit{-J'ai mis un autre gigot dans la marmite pour le dîner de ce soir et donc sa majesté le roi ne va pas en souffrir, mais le coupable doit être capturé !} \\

\textit{-En effet.} Le jeune homme dit en hochant la tête. \\

\textit{-Si vous permettez, Sire Maximilian... ?} L'une des femmes de chambre dit. \\

\textit{-Allez-y, je vous en prie.} \\

\textit{-Je me suis rendu à la cuisine il y a une heure. J'ai vu la marmite vide et j'ai cru que c'était étonnant mais je ne l'ai pas touchée. Le torchon était par terre et donc je l'ai ramassé et plié avant de le mettre sur la table, puis j'ai nettoyé le sol avant d'aller dans le jardin. Je ne suis retournée que maintenant pour trouver la cuisinière en train de crier à propos du gigot perdu. Celui ou celle qui l'a pris l'a sûrement fait avant que je ne sois rentrée dans la cuisine.} La jeune femme de chambre dit. \\

Maximilian hocha la tête en signe de compréhension avant de retourner son attention aux auteurs. \textit{-Est-ce que l'un de vous s'est rendu à la cuisine avant cela ?} L'autre femme de chambre et les gardes dirent non et il trouva le fait que seuls ceux qui étaient dans la pièce travaillaient dans la cuisine. \\

Le jeune frère de Maximilian prit la parole. \textit{-Est-ce que le sol de la cuisine était sale quand vous avez mariné le gigot d'agneau ce matin ?} Le petit garçon demanda à la cuisinière avec curiosité. \\

\textit{-Non. La cuisine est toujours nettoyée la nuit et quand je suis venue préparer l'agneau, il n'y avait même pas un grain de poussière sur le sol.} La cuisinière répondit. \\

Edward demanda en plus à la femme de chambre qui avait parlé auparavant pourquoi elle avait nettoyé le sol. \\

\textit{-Parce qu'il y avait une traînée de graisses sur le sol menant à la porte arrière. Il y avait aussi de la terre sur la traînée.} Dit-elle. \\

Le petit garçon regarda son frère et dit que cela devait signifier que celui ou celle qui avait pris l'agneau devait l'avoir traîné au jardin et cela expliquerait la traînée de graisse et ce que la femme de chambre pensait être de la terre devait être les épices et les herbes. \\

\textit{-Oui, c'est logique. As-tu vu l'un des enfants traîner quelque chose hors de la cuisine ?} Son grand-frère demanda. \\

Seul un enfant aurait besoin de traîner un gigot d'agneau puisqu'un adulte serait assez fort pour le porter. \\

\textit{-Non, mais je crois que je sais qui est le voleur.} Le petit garçon prit ensuite la main de son frère et le tira hors de la cuisine et dans le jardin jusqu'à ce qu'ils arrivèrent à la niche du chien du prince. \\

Quand Maximilian s'agenouilla par terre et regarda à l'intérieur, il trouva le chien endormi, blotti autour du gigot perdu qui était à présent à moitié consommé. \\

La cuisinière, les femmes de chambre et les gardes suivirent le jeune chevalier qui se tourna vers eux avec un sourire. \textit{-Je crois que ça résout notre devinette.} Puis, il se tourna vers la cuisinière et mit un bras autour des épaules d'Edward. \textit{-Je crois qu'il a mérité une gâterie pour avoir résolu le mystère, pas vrai ?} \\

La cuisinière claqua sa langue, lamentant le gigot gâché et hocha sa tête. \textit{-Venez à la cuisine, j'ai quelques tartelettes aux fraises de ce matin qui sont encore fraîches.}
